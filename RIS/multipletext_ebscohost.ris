AB  - Previous research has identified various factors that contribute to readers' comprehension of expository texts, including strategy expertise, language proficiency, prior knowledge, and more recently, readers' beliefs about knowledge. This study addresses the need to understand the relative contributions of these predictors to readers' comprehension of multiple texts and the processes used by readers to make sense of texts. Eighty-three students (grades 5-7) participated in this mixed-methods study. The sample consisted of monolingual students and emergent and proficient bilingual students who completed measures of expository comprehension, strategic knowledge and awareness, English-language proficiency, prior content knowledge, and epistemic beliefs. Ten bilingual students from this sample also completed a think-aloud protocol to allow for close examination of their meaning-making processes. In a multiple regression analysis, English-language proficiency was the strongest predictor of comprehension, followed by content knowledge. Strategy knowledge and awareness and epistemic beliefs were not related to multiple-text comprehension in the model. The relationship between English-language proficiency and comprehension was stronger for bilingual students than for monolingual students. Students in the think-aloud sample demonstrated emergent knowledge of processes of disciplinary reading of multiple texts, including metacognitive monitoring, theorizing authorial identity, and intertextual integration, while also displaying a tendency to defer to institutionalized authority when evaluating credibility of the texts. The findings provide directions for future research on the way young adolescents comprehend and learn from expository texts in the discipline of science. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]
AB  - Spanish Estudios previos han identificado varios factores que contribuyen a la comprensión de textos expositivos, los cuales incluyen la pericia estratégica, la competencia lingüística, el conocimiento previo, y recientemente, las creencias de los lectores sobre el conocimiento. Este estudio se enfoca en la necesidad de entender las contribuciones relativas de estos predictores a la comprensión de los lectores de múltiples textos y los procesos usados por los lectores para elaborar el sentido de los textos. Ochenta y tres estudiantes (grados 5-7) participaron en este estudio de métodos surtidos. La muestra consistió de estudiantes monolingües y estudiantes bilingües emergentes y hábiles quienes completaron medidas de comprensión expositiva, conciencia estratégica y conocimiento estratégico, habilidad lingüística del inglés, conocimiento previo del contenido, y creencias epistémicas. Diez estudiantes bilingües de esta muestra también completaron un protocolo en voz alta para poder examinar de cerca sus procesos de la elaboración de sentido. En un análisis de regresión múltiple, la habilidad lingüística del inglés fue el predictor más importante de la comprensión, seguida por el conocimiento del contenido. La conciencia estratégica, el conocimiento estratégico y las creencias epistémicas no mostraron tener relación a la comprensión de múltiples textos en este modelo. La relación entre la comprensión y la habilidad lingüística del inglés fue más importante en los estudiantes bilingües que en los estudiantes monolingües. Los estudiantes en la muestra de pensar en voz alta demostraron conocimiento emergente de los procesos de la lectura disciplinaria de múltiples textos, incluyendo el control metacognitivo, el teorizar sobre la identidad del autor, y la integración intertextual al mismo tiempo que mostraron una tendencia a deferir a la autoridad institucional al evaluar la credibilidad de los textos. Las conclusiones ofrecen orientación para estudios futuros sobre la forma en que adolescentes jóvenes comprenden y aprenden de textos expositivos en las disciplinas de las ciencias (Spanish) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]
AB  - French Les recherches existantes ont identifié différents facteurs qui contribuent à la compréhension par les lecteurs des textes déclaratifs, notamment l'expertise stratégique, l'aisance linguistique, les connaissances antérieures et, plus récemment, leurs conceptions de la connaissance. Cette recherche répond au besoin de savoir quelle est la contribution relative de ces prédicteurs à la compréhension qu'ont les lecteurs de différents textes et les processus qu'ils utilisent pour les comprendre. Quatre-vingt-trois élèves (classes de 5e, 6e, et 7e année) ont participé à une étude comportant pluri méthodologique. L'échantillon était composé d'élèves unilingues, de bons élèves bilingues et d'élèves émergents afin d'obtenir des évaluations sur la compréhension de textes déclaratifs, les connaissances, la conscience des stratégies, la maîtrise de l'anglais, la connaissance du contexte antérieur, et les conceptions épistémiques. Dix de ces élèves ont aussi passé un protocole de pensée à voix haute en vue d'une analyse plus complète de la façon dont ils procèdent pour donner du sens. Dans une analyse de régression multiple, l'anglais apparaît comme le plus fort prédicteur de la compréhension, suivi de la connaissance du contexte. Les connaissances et la conscience des stratégies ainsi que les conceptions épistémiques ne sont pas corrélées avec la compréhension des différents textes dans le modèle. Les relations entre la maîtrise de l'anglais et la compréhension est plus forte chez les élèves bilingues que chez les monolingues. Les élèves de l'échantillon de l'épreuve de pensée à voix haute présentent une connaissance émergente des processus de lecture des textes en fonction de la discipline, y compris un pilotage métacognitif, une théorisation de l'identité de l'auteur, une intégration intertextuelle, ainsi qu'une tendance à se référer à l'autorité institutionnelle lors de l'évaluation de la crédibilité des textes. Ces résultats donnent des directions pour de futures recherches sur la façon dont les jeunes adolescents comprennent et font des apprentissages à partir de textes déclaratifs dans le domaine scientifique.

AB  - The demands of learning in the twenty-first century require being skilled in the use and comprehension of multiple documents. Some individual factors such as the metacognitive skill of theory of mind (ToM) are related to this ability. This study investigated the relationship between university students’ ability to comprehend multiple documents, measured through an argumentative essay task, and their ToM. The participants were 84 undergraduates. We assessed their ToM (using the strange stories task) and their mental state talk (using a think-aloud protocol during the reading of multiple documents—MSTR—and through the content of their subsequent written essays—MSTW). The relation between students’ ToM and their MSTW was mediated through MSTR. In addition, students’ ToM was significantly associated with the quality of the essays, through MSTR, and the relation between MSTR and the argumentative quality was mediated through MSTW. MSTW was the only significant predictor of the quality of the essays. The involvement of ToM in multiple-document comprehension suggests, from an educational perspective, the possibility to support multiple-document comprehension by scaffolding mental state talk.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to analyze visual attention during students' learning of Toulmin's argument pattern (TAP) and the effects of epistemic beliefs in science on the understanding of argument components. A total of 43 undergraduates were recruited through the Internet. Online questionnaires targeting beliefs about knowledge in science [Conley, A. M., Pintrich, P. R., Vekiri, I., & Harrison, D. (2004). Changes in epistemological beliefs in elementary science students. Contemporary Educational Psychology, 29(2), 186–204] and beliefs about justification for knowing in science [Ferguson, L. E., & Bråten, I. (2013). Student profiles of knowledge and epistemic beliefs: Changes and relations to multiple-text comprehension. Learning and Instruction, 25, 49–61] were used to assess students' epistemic beliefs. Identification tests for the understanding of TAP were performed before and after an argument reading treatment designed as a self-learning activity. The whole reading process was recorded by the eye-tracking system. To explore the effect of the reading treatment, participants were divided into a progress (P) group and a no-progress (NP) group based on their learning gains.The results indicated that students' epistemic beliefs in science and their learning strategies would affect their TAP learning performance. The analyses of visual attention distribution indicated that integration information indicated by inter-scanning counts would enhance students' learning performance. In addition, the LSA results suggested that understanding of data is of primary importance when learning TAP. Suggestions on how to guide students in learning TAP are provided based on the findings.

AB  - Background: The issue of science is seldom brought into focus because of the way developing assessments of students' multiple text reading comprehension. Objectives: This study tested the sequential mediation model of scientific multi-text reading comprehension (SMTRC) by means of structural equation modelling (SEM), and aimed to advance the scientific multi-text reading comprehension assessment (SMTRCA), with a focus on discussing the causal relationship of potential variables in SMTRC. Method: Test items included 10 closed-ended and 7 open-ended questions and were categorised into four subscales: information retrieval (IR), information generalisation (IG), information interpretation (IIP), and information integration (IIG). Results: The confirmatory factor analysis results showed that there was an acceptable goodness-of-fit among the SMTRCA, indicating that the construct validity was good. Furthermore, the Cronbach's α of the test items was 0.88, indicating good internal consistency. In addition, using 1535 students, structural equation modelling was applied to analyse the relations of the latent variables. The findings showed that when readers are performing multi-text reading comprehension, IR will simultaneously have direct influences on IG, IIP and IIG. Moreover, through IG, IR had an indirect impact on IIP; through IIP, IG had an indirect impact on IIG; through the two intermediate mediators of IG and IIP, IR had an indirect impact on IIG. Conclusion: In our data-driven model, multi-text reading comprehension is a hierarchical and complex cognitive process. That is to say, when an individual is engaging in multi-text reading comprehension, they will not just follow a single approach, but will deal with several cognitive processing routes simultaneously. Recommendations are made for future research to explore the cognitive model of scientific multi-text reading comprehension and to determine whether there are differences among multiple groups, as well as standard setting to define the cut-off scores of the criterion-referenced model, to develop an assessment reporting system of scientific multi-text reading comprehension, and strategies for scientific multi-text reading.

AB  - In recent years, great enthusiasm has been expressed about the benefits of the digital textbook, which is capturing more and more of the academic book market. However, questions remain about the extent to which e-textbooks actually improve educational outcomes, especially with respect to the impact for students in political science. Using a quasi-experimental design employed in introductory political science courses, this research begins to address these limitations by directly assessing the impact of the online text platform on several different educational outcomes. The results indicate that the digital format has a positive impact on both students' self-report of engagement with the textbook and on reading compliance levels, although a student's interest in politics was found to be an important mediating factor. Text format is not a significant predictor for most measures of academic performance, although assignment of the e-textbook is associated with substantially lower average course grades. Greater student involvement with supplemental resources provided by the digital platform, however, has a strong and positive impact on performance on all learning measures. The results therefore suggest that if students are properly encouraged or required to interact with the digital text platform, the benefits of using the e-textbook outweigh the potential drawbacks.

AB  - This study examined 57 learners' emotions (i.e., joy, anger, confusion, frustration) as they engaged with scientific content while learning about microbiology with Crystal Island, a game-based learning environment (GBLE). Measures of learners' prior knowledge, in-game text comprehension, facial expressions of emotion, and posttest reading comprehension were collected to examine the relationship between emotions and single- and multiple-text comprehension. Analyses found that both discrete and non-discrete emotions were expressed during reading and answering in-game assessments of single-text comprehension. Learners expressed greater joy during reading and greater expressions of anger, confusion, and frustration during in-game assessments. Further results found that learners who expressed a high number of different emotions throughout reading and completing in-game assessments tended to have lower in-game comprehension scores whereas a higher number of different expressed emotions while completing in-game assessments was associated with greater posttest comprehension. Finally, while increased prior knowledge was associated with higher single- and multiple-text comprehension, there was no interaction between prior knowledge and emotions on multiple-text comprehension. Overall, this study found that (1) learners often express more than one emotion during GBLE activities, (2) emotions expressed while learning with a GBLE shift across different activities, and (3) emotions are related to demonstrated comprehension, but the type of activity influences this relationship. Results from this study provide implications for how emotions can be examined as learners engage in GBLE activities as well as the design of GBLEs to support learners' emotions accounting for different activity demands to increase comprehension of single and multiple texts.

AB  - One‐hundred and twenty‐seven Norwegian upper‐secondary school students completing college preparatory courses (41% female) were asked to select the texts they wanted to use in order to write a letter to the editor about a socio‐scientific topic, with 60 students assigned the topic of climate change and 67 students assigned the topic of nuclear power. Afterwards, they were asked to justify their text selections, read the selected texts and write their letters to the editor. Across both topics, hierarchical multiple regression analyses showed that students' behavioural engagement in the selection, justification, reading and writing tasks contributed to their performance over and above their reading comprehension, topic knowledge and topic interest. Specifically, behavioural engagement in the selection and justification tasks improved the prediction of their content‐based and source‐feature based justifications for text selection, and behavioural engagement in the reading and writing tasks improved the prediction of the content coverage and content integration observed in their written products, with large effect sizes obtained for behavioural engagement across the two topics. The theoretical and educational significance of the study is discussed and directions for future research are suggested. Highlights: What is already known about this topicReading and writing tasks involving multiple documents are a great challenge for many students.Theory and research in this area have emphasised the importance of cognitive competencies and motivational dispositions. What this paper addsThe findings indicate that the time, effort and persistence that students put into multiple document tasks may matter more that their cognitive competencies and motivational dispositions.Prior research in multiple document literacy may have underestimated students' competencies because it has not taken their behavioural engagement (or lack of it) into consideration. Implications for theory, policy or practiceTheoretical frameworks of multiple document literacy need to address the importance of behavioural engagement in multiple document task contexts.Literacy educators in the 21st century need to focus on the promotion of student engagement in challenging reading tasks involving multiple documents.

AB  - In this study, we used eye-tracking methodology for deeper understanding of the refutation text effect on online text comprehension. A refutation text acknowledges the reader's alternative conceptions about a phenomenon, refutes them and presents the correct conceptions. We tested two hypotheses about its facilitation effect: the coherence hypothesis (refutation text is more coherent than standard text, thus facilitating comprehension) and the elaboration hypothesis (refutation text involves deeper processing, thus facilitating comprehension). Forty university students read one refutation text and one non-refutation text about two science topics. Offline data confirmed that refutation text readers recall more scientific facts than non-refutation text readers. Online eye-tracking measures revealed both an increase and a decrease in reading time in response to the refutation statements. Topic-medial text sentences with the correct science facts were fixated for a shorter time when first encountered in the refutation text. Refutation statements, however, increased integrative processing at the end of each text paragraph, as indexed by longer look-back fixation times on topic-final sentences with the science concepts, as well as longer look-back fixation times directed to the refutation statements. These findings support the elaboration hypothesis and are discussed in the light of current accounts of the refutation effect for theory development and educational practice. Lay Description What is already known about this topic: Science texts are often challenging to read, especially when the reader has misconceptions about the topicand must undergo conceptual-change learning in order to successfully comprehend the text., A specific type of text, the refutation text, mayact as a powerful resource in facilitating conceptual change, but findings from process-oriented investigations have been inconclusive with respect to its efficacy in this regard., What this paper adds: Refutation statements lead to faster processing of scientific facts that contradict commonly held misconceptions during the first-pass reading., Refutation statements also encourage readers' later integrative processing during rereading,to monitor and ensure resolution of the conflict between their own conceptions and the conceptual information contained within the text., Implications for practice and/or policy: Immediate introduction of new science concepts in an expository text may not benefit readers' comprehension when they have existing misconceptions within the relevant knowledge domain., The use of sentences explicitly refuting readers' misconceptions has the potential to induce and sustain the conscious and deliberate processing that is required for them to become aware of the conceptual conflict, increasing their likelihood of resolving it., Update made on 05 November 2016, after first online publication: Since the publication of this article, a Practitioner Notes section has been implemented for this journal. This article has been updated with the Practitioner Notes section. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Learning from different representations, such as text and pictures, is supposed to be more effective than learning from text alone. However, there is very limited research on potential differences between students with and without dyslexia with respect to learning from different representations. This study compared students with and without dyslexia working with multiple information sources on a socio-scientific issue in a digital environment. Participants were 44 Norwegian tenth-graders, of whom 22 were diagnosed with dyslexia. All participants were presented with a researcher generated Internet site containing three different web pages, each including a video, a text, and a picture, on which conflicting perspectives on the controversial issue of sun exposure and health were discussed. In a first session, participants' topic knowledge, word recognition, and working memory were measured. In a second session, participants studied the three web pages to prepare an oral presentation on the issue, before they again completed the topic knowledge measure and responded to two integrative questions that assessed their integration of information across web pages and representations. No reliable differences were found between the two groups with regard to pre-reading topic knowledge, post-reading topic knowledge, or knowledge gain. However, participants without dyslexia clearly outperformed participants with dyslexia on multiple source integration and were much more likely to draw on textual sources when trying to integrate information across different web pages and representations. Results also suggested that observed differences with respect to multiple source integration were largely due to working memory differences between the two groups of students. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Introduction. The aim of this study was to analyse the role of epistemological beliefs and reading beliefs in the comprehension of multiple texts which presented conflicting positions about a controversial topic (nuclear energy). More specifically, we investigated the influence of the multidimensional configuration of epistemological and reading beliefs on multiple text comprehension. Method. The participants were 476 university students from two different Spanish universities, and diverse studies (Humanities, Health Sciences, Architecture and Engineering). In a whole-class session, the Epistemological Beliefs Questionnaire (EQEBI) and the Reader Belief Questionnaire were first administered. In the second part of the session participants completed the prior knowledge questionnaire and performed the multiple text comprehension task. Results. Using cluster analysis we identified two distinct beliefs profiles: sophisticated, in which the more sophisticated epistemological beliefs were associated to more trans-actional and less transmissive reading beliefs; and naive, in which the more naive epistemological beliefs were associated to less transactional and more transmissive reading beliefs. Relationships were found between profiles and gender and domain of knowledge. In addition, after controlling prior knowledge, students with a more sophisticated epistemological and reading beliefs' profile obtained a higher level of multiple text comprehension than those with a more naive profile. Conclusion. Consistent with prior research, we may interpret that students who understand knowledge in a more sophisticated way tend to view reading less as a transmissive process and more transforming of knowledge; therefore, they get involved in a deeper comprehension of the different sources and this favours their ability to process information and make inferences - at an intra and inter textual level.

AB  - Introducción. El ojetivo de este estudio fue analizar el papel de las creencias epistemológicas y de lectura en la comprensión de multiples textos que presentan posiciones contradictorias sobre un tema controvertido (la energía nuclear). En concreto, se investigó la influencia de la configuración multidimensional de creencias epistemológicas y de lectura en la comprensión de múltiples textos. Método. En el estudio participaron 476 estudiantes universitarios de dos universidades españolas y de distintas titulaciones (Humanidades, Ciencias de la Salud, Arquitectura e Ingeniería). Durante una clase se aplicó el Epistemological Beliefs Questionnaire (EQEBI) y el Reader Belief Questionnaire. En la siguiente, los participantes contestaron el cuestionario de conocimiento previo y realizaron la tarea de comprensión a partir de múltiples textos. Resultados. Se identificaron dos perfiles de creencias a través de un análisis de cluster: sofisticado, en el que las creencias epistemológicas sofisticadas están asociadas con creencias sobre la lectura más transaccionales y con las menos transmisivas; e ingenuo, en el que las creencias epistemológicas más ingenuas están asociadas con creencias sobre la lectura menos trasacciona-les y con las más transmisivas. Se encontraron relaciones entre los perfiles y el género y el dominio de conocimiento. Los resultados muestran también que, una vez controlado el conocimiento previo, los estudiantes con creencias epistemológicas y de lectura más sofisticadas obtienen mejores resultados en la tarea de comprensión a partir de múltiples textos que aquellos que responden a un perfil ingenuo. Conclusion. Según los resultados, que coinciden con los de otros estudios, interpretaríamos que los estudiantes que conciben el conocimiento de una manera más sofisticada tienden a considerar la lectura menos como un proceso transmisivo y más como una transformación del conocimiento; por ello realizan una comprensión más profunda de las diferentes fuentes y esto favorece su capacidad de procesar información y hacer inferencias -en un nivel tanto inter como intra textual.

AB  - Little evidence is available regarding the differential impact of reading versus reading and writing on multiple source comprehension. The present study aims to: (1) compare the inferential comprehension performance of students in reading versus reading/synthesis conditions; (2) explore the impact of performing the tasks on paper versus on screen with Read&Answer (R&A) software; and (3) explore the extent to which rereading, notetaking, and the quality of the written synthesis can explain student’s comprehension scores. For the students in the synthesis condition, we also examined the relationship between the quality of the synthesis they produced and the comprehension they achieved. 155 psychology undergraduates were randomly assigned either to the reading (n = 78) or to the reading/synthesis condition (n = 77). From this sample, 79 participants carried out the task with the Read&Answer software, and 76 solved the task on paper. All the students took a prior knowledge questionnaire, and read three complementary texts about the conception of intelligence. Students in the reading condition answered an inferential comprehension test, whereas students in the synthesis condition were asked to write a synthesis before taking the same test. Results show no differences in comprehension between students in the four conditions (task and media). There was no significant association between rereading and task condition. However, students in the synthesis condition were more likely to take notes. We found that two of the categories for the quality of the synthesis, textual organization and accuracy of content had an impact on inferential comprehension for the participants who wrote it. The quality of the synthesis mediated between student’s prior knowledge and inferential comprehension. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study reports on the development of and first data collection for MISSIONS WITH MONTY, a game-based learning environment (GBLE) targeting metacomprehension skills for 5th graders on expository science texts. The project is in the first year of a three-year grant funded by the National Science Foundation, USA. The intent of the study is to 1) examine the effectiveness of the prototype of MISSIONS WITH MONTY, and 2) test the impact of sound effects on student interest and performance. MISSIONS WITH MONTY includes three key curricular units (ecosystems, Earth and human activity, from molecules to organisms) that align with state and national standards. In MISSIONS WITH MONTY the player fills the role of a promising young science professor traveling to work with Monty, a monitor lizard and world-renowned scientist known for his ability to solve real-life problems. Monty has created Wildlife University (WU) in a remote rainforest. The students and professors at WU are different animals focused on becoming more scientifically literate in order to save their natural habitats. Unfortunately, upon arrival at WU the player realizes that 1) Monty has gone missing and 2) WU has been recently closed due to animals getting sick. Thus, the player is provided with the challenge of undertaking a series of missions in order to save Monty to determine the cause of the sickness by developing skills for highlighting, summarization, metacognitive monitoring, and multiple-source comprehension. Players will visit a number of different animal scientists who lead research camps in the rainforest, ocean, and savanna and engage students in a series of mini-games clustered by content-related texts. Players eventually engage in two final mini-games that involve argumentation skills to solve the two overall primary dilemmas. Development of MISSIONS WITH MONTY is occurring through a collaborative process with participating students and teachers and the current data collection will focus only on the series of interactions from the first mini-game. Students will be randomly assigned to sound effects or no sound effects conditions. Data from group comparison will be the focus of the conference presentation. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Background: With digital technologies, competence assessments can provide process data, such as mouse clicks with corresponding timestamps, as additional information about the skills and strategies of test takers. However, in order to use variables generated from process data sensibly for educational purposes, their interpretation needs to be validated with regard to their intended meaning. Aims: This study seeks to demonstrate how process data from an assessment of multiple document comprehension can be used to represent sourcing, which summarizes activities for the consideration of the origin and intention of documents. The investigated process variables were created according to theoretical assumptions about sourcing, and systematically tested for differences between persons, units (i.e., documents and items), and properties of the test administration. Sample: The sample included 310 German university students (79.4% female), enrolled in several bachelor's or master's programmes of the social sciences and humanities. Methods: Regarding the hierarchical data structure, the hypotheses were analysed with generalized linear mixed models (GLMM). Results: The results mostly revealed expected differences between individuals and units. However, unexpected effects of the administered order of units and documents were detected. Conclusions: The study demonstrates the theory‐informed construction of process variables from log‐files and an approach for empirical validation of their interpretation. The results suggest that students apply sourcing for different reasons, but also stress the need of further validation studies and refinements in the operationalization of the indicators investigated.

AB  - Multiple text comprehension can greatly benefit from paying attention to sources and from using this information for evaluating text information. Previous research based on texts from the domain of history suggests that source-related strategies are acquired as part of the discipline expertise as opposed to the spontaneous use of these strategies by students just entering a field. In the present study, we compared the performance of students and scientists in the domain of psychology with regard to (a) their knowledge of publication types, (b) relevant source characteristics, (c) their use of sources for evaluating the credibility of multiple texts, and (d) their ability to judge the plausibility of argumentative statements in psychological texts. Participants worked on a battery of newly developed computerised tests with a think-aloud instruction to uncover strategies that scientists and students used when reading a text. Results showed that scientists scored higher in all of the assessed abilities and that these abilities were positively correlated with each other. Importantly, the superior performance of scientists in evaluating the credibility of multiple texts was mediated by their use of source information. Implications are discussed in terms of discipline expertise. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Readers confronted with unfamiliar and controversial scientific debates tend to rely on simple heuristics such as the perceived plausibility to focus their cognitive resources on specific information during comprehension. In the present experiment, we tested the assumption that plausibility judgments as an integral part of comprehension are used as a simple heuristic to distribute cognitive resources to controversial texts, leading to a better comprehension of information judged as plausible. To experimentally vary perceived plausibility, participants (N = 54 university students) watched one of two video versions on the controversy of spider silk. The videos provided identical factual information but took opposing argumentative claims on the issue (pro vs. con). Afterward, participants read two conflicting texts (pro vs. con) on the same issue. Plausibility judgments and comprehension for the texts were assessed. In line with the hypothesized mediation model, results revealed that the belief manipulation (i.e., the video versions) affected the perceived plausibility of the controversial texts, which in turn influenced the comprehension of the two texts. The effect of the belief-manipulation, that is, participants' better comprehension of the text that took the same argumentative stance as the video, was fully mediated by perceived plausibility. These results are relevant for educational interventions to improve the comprehension of controversial but unfamiliar scientific studies and for theories on the role of plausibility in (multiple) text comprehension. Educational Impact and Implications Statement: Readers often use superficially created beliefs to evaluate the plausibility or credibility of statements from controversial texts on unfamiliar topics as part of normal comprehension. The consequence is a better understanding of information that is judged as plausible but a reduced understanding for information judged as implausible. In times of misinformation and fake news spread throughout the World Wide Web, such preferential processing of information perceived as plausible because it is consistent with one's beliefs hampers readers' ability to fully understand and evaluate complex socioscientific issues, to form well-justified argumentative positions, and to make informed decisions.

AB  - Research over the last two decades has shown middle school EBs are at risk for academic failure due to compounded systematic challenges that prevented them from acquiring reading proficiency level required to succeed in academic setting (Bowman-Perrott et al., 2010; Deussen et al., 2017; Sheng et al., 2011; Slama, 2012). EBs face shortages of qualified teachers, lack of access to quality instruction, and lack of appropriate assessment tools (Carnoy & Garcia, 2017; Sanchez, 2017; Umansky, 2016). This crisis is particularly acute for middle schoolers, as academic content often requires extensive reading. Middle school EBs are falling behind academically in comparison to their non-EB peers, disproportionately identified in special education, and more likely to be retained or drop out of school (Gandara & Hopkins, 2010). Currently the available research suggests that&#xa0;vocabulary instruction is essential for older EBs literacy skills and best practices in vocabulary intervention could be applied to support EBs (Baker et al., 2014; Hall et al., 2017; Vaughn, 2022) . The current study examined the effectiveness of an online, text-based vocabulary intervention program on EB's academic vocabulary knowledge, reading fluency, and reading comprehension. Using a multiple-baseline design, four EBs were provided with six weeks intervention. Visual analysis and descriptive statistics was used to analyzed the result. Results indicate improvement from baseline to interventions on word knowledge for both target and non-target words. However, the result did not show improvements on reading fluency and comprehension. The findings from the current study encourage continued research on text-based vocabulary intervention to support middle school EBs with varying demographic characteristics reading achievements such as vocabulary knowledge, reading fluency, and comprehension.&#xa0; (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The purpose of the current research was to explore the detrimental effects of proactive interference during multiple text comprehension and whether it could be reduced by intentionally forgetting the interfering information using the directed forgetting paradigm. In Experiment 1, a subset of participants read 10 argumentative texts on the same topic (control condition), whereas others read 20. Of those who read 20, some were instructed to remember all texts (proactive interference condition), whereas others were instructed after reading the first 10 texts to forget them and remember only the next 10 (directed forgetting condition). On final recognition tests of the texts' claims and evidence, the proactive interference and directed forgetting conditions performed similarly—both with higher intrusion errors from earlier-read texts compared to the control condition. Results suggested that directed forgetting instructions did not help participants reduce proactive interference. Experiment 2 added the manipulation of text topic relatedness, which ultimately did not have any bearing on the effectiveness of directed forgetting instructions. Additional exploratory analyses using reading time, response time, d', and investigation of one-sided non-compliance could not shed conclusive light on an explanation for the lack of benefit of directed forgetting. Potential reasons and avenues of future research are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study investigated how and how often to present prompts to enhance students’ source evaluation and multiple-text comprehension. Participants were 72 undergraduates who read a set of digital texts on a controversial topic of smartphone use and mental health, wrote a justification statement for their selection of trustworthy texts, and answered open-ended comprehension questions. To explore the optimal presentation conditions, this study varied the presentation format (matrix vs. question) and frequency (once vs. repeated) of prompts. The results showed that participants benefited more from the matrix prompt than the question prompt in source evaluation and multiple-text comprehension. An interaction effect occurred only in multiple-text comprehension, indicating that repeated prompting via matrix was an optimal approach to facilitate integration of text information. In addition, participants perceived less cognitive load when matrix was presented than when questions were presented. Taken together, these results have classroom implications for instructors to consider both the format and frequency of presenting prompts to facilitate source evaluation and comprehension of multiple conflicting-view articles.

AB  - Sixty-five Norwegian 10th graders used the software Read&Answer 2.0 (Vidal-Abarca et al., ) to read five different texts presenting conflicting views on the controversial scientific issue of sun exposure and health. Participants were administered a multiple-choice topic-knowledge measure before and after reading, a word recognition task, and a reading motivation inventory that included two dimensions: Science reading self-efficacy, focusing on readers' beliefs about their capabilities to comprehend what they read in science, and science reading task value, focusing on readers' beliefs about how important, useful, and interesting it is to comprehend science texts. In addition, strategic reading pattern was assessed in terms of the degree of non-linear reading behavior. Multiple regression analysis showed that word recognition skills strongly predicted learning from the texts, as assessed by participants' increase in topic knowledge. However, when multiple-text comprehension indicated by performance on open-ended short-essay questions was the dependent variable, not only word recognition but also strategic reading pattern and science reading self-efficacy emerged as unique predictors when topic knowledge was controlled for. Science reading task value was not related to performance. This study provides new evidence that new literacy competencies needed in a knowledge society, such as synthesizing or integrating across multiple conflicting sources of information, still largely involve word-level, strategic, and motivational processes that may profitably be targeted through systematic instruction.

AB  - Abstract Historical reasoning, as a disciplinary literacy, aims to develop higher-order thinking in addition to depth of historical knowledge beyond the textbook and memorization of facts. It teaches students to use information across multiple sources to contextualize and corroborate historical accounts, constructing an informed yet critical interpretation of events. Studies on the use of multiple sources to develop historical reasoning among students with learning differences (ld) are scarce. This qualitative study seeks to explore and describe how twelve 7th grade students in a special education classroom used multiple historical sources when writing argumentative/expository essays. The 96 total essays that students wrote throughout the academic year are the primary data source for this paper. Data memos, lesson plans, and interview transcripts were used to triangulate the findings found in the essays. Based on a thematic analysis, three major themes emerged: (1) students with ld demonstrated discipline-specific cognitive processes (e.g., sourcing, corroboration, contextualization) when using multiple historical sources in their essays; (2) students with ld leveraged the use of multiple historical sources in writing essays, mediated by a range of interests toward multiple source use; and (3) high-quality instruction characterized by scaffolding (i.e., gradual release of responsibility) for reading and writing fostered students with ld’s understanding of historical events and historical reasoning using multiple sources. This paper offers implications for policy, research, and practice related to multiple source use among students with ld. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: The issue of science is seldom brought into focus because of the way developing assessments of students' multiple text reading comprehension. Objectives: This study tested the sequential mediation model of scientific multi-text reading comprehension (SMTRC) by means of structural equation modelling (SEM), and aimed to advance the scientific multi-text reading comprehension assessment (SMTRCA), with a focus on discussing the causal relationship of potential variables in SMTRC. Method: Test items included 10 closed-ended and 7 open-ended questions and were categorised into four subscales: information retrieval (IR), information generalisation (IG), information interpretation (IIP), and information integration (IIG). Results: The confirmatory factor analysis results showed that there was an acceptable goodness-of-fit among the SMTRCA, indicating that the construct validity was good. Furthermore, the Cronbach's a of the test items was 0.88, indicating good internal consistency. In addition, using 1535 students, structural equation modelling was applied to analyse the relations of the latent variables. The findings showed that when readers are performing multitext reading comprehension, IR will simultaneously have direct influences on IG, IIP and IIG. Moreover, through IG, IR had an indirect impact on IIP; through IIP, IG had an indirect impact on IIG; through the two intermediate mediators of IG and IIP, IR had an indirect impact on IIG. Conclusion: In our data-driven model, multi-text reading comprehension is a hierarchical and complex cognitive process. That is to say, when an individual is engaging in multi-text reading comprehension, they will not just follow a single approach, but will deal with several cognitive processing routes simultaneously. Recommendations are made for future research to explore the cognitive model of scientific multi-text reading comprehension and to determine whether there are differences among multiple groups, as well as standard setting to define the cut-off scores of the criterion-referenced model, to develop an assessment reporting system of scientific multi-text reading comprehension, and strategies for scientific multi-text reading.

AB  - Abstract The present study examined reading interactions and multiple document comprehension of 108 university students who read five partly conflicting documents on a health-related issue. Documents were presented on a large touch interface that either enabled a simultaneous or imposed a sequential presentation of the documents. None of the three multiple document comprehension measures (number of intertextual connections in essays, score in source-content mapping task, and number of source names recalled) was affected by document presentation. However, in the sequential condition, the number of revisits to documents was positively related to memory for source names and source-content integration, but not to intertextual integration. Conversely, in the simultaneous condition, participants who grouped documents during reading showed greater intertextual and source-content integration, but no greater memory for source names than those who had not grouped documents. To conclude, reading interactions played a more important role in readers’ multiple document comprehension than document presentation. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background Processing and comprehending information from multiple sources have been a primary means of learning and are essential 21st‐century skills to construct knowledge for a deeper understanding. Objectives This study examined students' individual differences in search strategies and internet epistemic beliefs as well as the effect of distinct note‐taking formats on students' online multiple‐document reading about measurement scales and statistical graphs, considering students' gender and prior knowledge. Methods Participants were 124 Taiwanese university students (79% female) taking the Educational Statistics course in three different classes. I used a quasi‐experimental design to test the effect of different note‐taking formats on online multiple document reading. Three classes of students were randomly assigned to one of the experimental conditions with sourcing cues: the individual note taking with multiple tabs, the collaborative note taking with multiple tabs, or the individual note taking in a single tab. Results and conclusion The study showed that the uncertainty belief about Internet‐based information and note‐taking formats predicted students' online multiple document reading. A stronger belief that the internet information is uncertain and may change with time positively predict online multiple document reading comprehension. Moreover, individuals taking notes in a single tab outperformed those taking notes individually in separate tabs. Major takeaways from the study Implications for instruction were made to foster students' uncertainty belief and teach them how to construct pre‐outlined tables with sourcing cues to collect the contextual information and reflect on the source information to streamline learners' online multiple document reading comprehension.

AB  - Background: Online multiple‐text comprehension is a key skill of the 21st Century, yet the study of its relations with boredom in young students has been disregarded. Boredom is an achievement emotion expected to be predicted negatively by antecedents like control and value appraisals and to be associated to a negative performance. Notwithstanding its documented domain‐specificity, scarce attention has been paid to investigating these relations with primary‐school students in the reading domain, and specifically for online multiple‐text comprehension, and to how such relations are moderated by basic cognitive abilities. Aims: Considering separately two settings (homework, test), we studied the mediation of boredom in the relation between control‐value appraisals and online multiple‐text comprehension in primary‐school students, focusing on the moderating role of word‐reading fluency. Sample: Participants were 334 fourth and fifth graders. Methods: We evaluated students’ reading‐related self‐efficacy and task‐value, reading‐related boredom for homework and tests, word‐reading fluency, and online multiple‐text comprehension. Results: Path analyses revealed negative relations between control‐value appraisals and boredom for homework and tests, and between boredom and online multiple‐text comprehension for tests only. For the latter, word‐reading fluency moderated the relation between appraisals, boredom, and comprehension: Boredom negatively related to comprehension only for students with high word‐reading fluency. Conclusions: Findings are discussed focusing on antecedents of online multiple‐text comprehension as a literacy skill critical in the 21st Century. We underlined their implications for learning in general and specifically for the current educational changes due to the COVID‐19 pandemic.

AB  - The present study examined the relationship between working memory capacity (WMC) and comprehension on a multiple text assessment from the ACT test for college preparedness in which texts are available during question answering. Specifically, it was of interest whether differences in relations would be seen across different question types. Only performance on the inference questions was uniquely related to WMC whereas performance on textbase and across-text questions was not. Results suggest that WMC still plays a role in comprehension even when texts are available, and the role of WMC seems to be most strongly tied to integration demands.

AB  - The current study examined the extent to which sixth grade students used their pre-existing topic beliefs to guide comprehension of semantic ideas within multiple conflicting texts, and the sources providing them. Adolescents completed an inventory assessing their pre-reading topic beliefs one week prior to the study. During the study, students read 6 controversial texts, completed an assessment of their metacognitive awareness during reading, and wrote an essay from memory based on information provided by the texts. A between-participants manipulation tasked adolescents to read opposing stances in an alternating format, or to read all arguments for one side prior to switching to the opposing arguments. Regarding the results, the extent of adolescents’ pro-vegetarian topic beliefs predicted their taking a pro-vegetarian stance, inclusion of more belief-consistent and fewer belief-inconsistent (pro-meat) ideas, and fewer mentions of sources in the essays. The extent of adolescents’ topic beliefs also positively predicted expressions of metacognitive awareness during reading. When contradictory stances were experienced in an alternating format, adolescents included more source information in their written essays than when they read all arguments for one side prior to switching to the opposing arguments. The findings have important implications for theories of multiple text comprehension and applications for adolescents’ everyday reading experiences on the web.

AB  - ABSTRACT This study examined 57 learners’ emotions (i.e., joy, anger, confusion, frustration) as they engaged with scientific content while learning about microbiology with Crystal Island, a game-based learning environment (GBLE). Measures of learners’ prior knowledge, in-game text comprehension, facial expressions of emotion, and posttest reading comprehension were collected to examine the relationship between emotions and single- and multiple-text comprehension. Analyses found that both discrete and non-discrete emotions were expressed during reading and answering in-game assessments of single-text comprehension. Learners expressed greater joy during reading and greater expressions of anger, confusion, and frustration during in-game assessments. Further results found that learners who expressed a high number of different emotions throughout reading and completing in-game assessments tended to have lower in-game comprehension scores whereas a higher number of different expressed emotions while completing in-game assessments was associated with greater posttest comprehension. Finally, while increased prior knowledge was associated with higher single- and multiple-text comprehension, there was no interaction between prior knowledge and emotions on multiple-text comprehension. Overall, this study found that (1) learners often express more than one emotion during GBLE activities, (2) emotions expressed while learning with a GBLE shift across different activities, and (3) emotions are related to demonstrated comprehension, but the type of activity influences this relationship. Results from this study provide implications for how emotions can be examined as learners engage in GBLE activities as well as the design of GBLEs to support learners’ emotions accounting for different activity demands to increase comprehension of single and multiple texts.

AB  - Multiple document (MD) comprehension is of growing interest in the Internet age, in which reading material is readily available from multiple sources. However, comprehension research has typically been dominated by studies investigating single documents (Bråten et al., 2019; McNamara & Magliano, 2009). This dissertation applies a memory-based approach traditionally used in research on single document comprehension to a MD context, with the goal of understanding the on-line processing and integration of information from multiple documents. Expository-style passages were created in which the first half contained information that was either consistent or inconsistent with a target sentence in the second half. A series of experiments measured reading times on the target sentences when the passage halves were presented as one single passage (Experiment I & IV) or as two separate passages, which were presented either consecutively (Experiment II & IV) or interleaved with an unrelated passage (Experiment III & IV). Reading time data revealed that, for all passage presentations, reading times were longer in the inconsistent condition compared to the consistent. These results indicate that information from earlier in the text or from previous passages was being reactivated and, when inconsistent, impacting on-line processing. In Experiment IV, a post-reading measure of memory for the inconsistencies revealed that participants' memory was better when the inconsistency occurred across passages compared to when it occurred within a single passage.

AB  - Background Data‐driven investigations of how students transit pages in digital reading tasks and how much time they spend on each transition allow mapping sequences of navigation behaviours into students' navigation reading strategies. Objectives The purpose of this study is threefold: (1) to identify students' navigation patterns in multiple‐source reading tasks using a sequence clustering approach; (2) to examine how students' navigation patterns are associated with their reading performance and socio‐demographic characteristics; (3) to showcase how the navigation sequences could be clustered on the similarity measure by dynamic time warping (DTW) methods. Methods This study draws on process data from a sample of 16,957 students from 69 countries participating in the PISA 2018 study to identify how students navigate through a multiple‐source reading item. Students' navigation sequences were characterized by two indicators: the page sequence that tracks the page transition path and the time sequence that records the time duration on each visited page. K‐medoid partitioning clustering analyses were conducted on pairwise distance similarity measures computed by the DTW method. Results and conclusions Students' navigation patterns were found moderately associated with their reading proficiency levels. Students who visited all the pages and spent more time reading without rush transitions obtained the highest reading scores. Girls were more likely to achieve higher scores than boys when longer navigation sequences were used with shorter reading time on transited pages. Students who navigated only limited pages and spent shorter reading time were averagely at the lowest rank of socio‐economic status. Implications This study provides evidence for the exploration of students' navigation patterns and the examination of associations between navigation patterns and reading scores with the use of process data.

AB  - Learners often have difficulties comprehending multiple texts about controversial scientific issues. In particular, learners with strong prior beliefs tend to construct a one-sided mental representation that is biased towards belief-consistent information (text-belief consistency effect). In the present study we examined the effectiveness of information of three metacognitive strategies tailored to strengthen the comprehension of belief-inconsistent information during multiple text comprehension. According to theories of self-regulated learning, knowledge about relevant metacognitive strategies improves comprehension only when learners are also motivated to use these strategies. These hypotheses were investigated in an experiment in which 85 participants read one belief-consistent and one belief-inconsistent text about a controversial scientific issue. Participants either received information about three metacognitive strategies or no additional information. In addition, participants' motivation was manipulated by providing them with either negative or positive performance feedback or no feedback. As predicted, a text-belief consistency effect was found, which was eliminated by strengthening the situation model for the belief-inconsistent text only when learners received information about relevant metacognitive strategies and were motivated to use these strategies after positive performance feedback.

AB  - In the present-day knowledge society, people need to critically comprehend information across multiple sources that express diverse and contradictory viewpoints. Due to the complexity associated with this process, an important role can be played by Executive Functions, that is, cognitive control processes used to regulate mental functioning and behavior when automatized elaborations are not sufficient. The aim of this article is to review existing research on the roles of executive functions when reading from multiple texts. To identify the appropriate studies, we conducted a search in the following databases: Web of science, Scopus, PsycInfo, Eric. The search string was created by combining the terms used in past literature reviews on executive functions and multiple-texts comprehension. From the total number of 4,877 records identified, seven articles met all the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Given the scarcity of studies on the topic, we decided to examine also eight articles reporting indirect evidence about the association between executive functions and multiple-text comprehension. Our review revealed that the study of the association between executive functions and multiple-texts comprehension is underdeveloped. The results seem to suggest that working memory is involved in surface comprehension, whereas results about sourcing and intertextual integration processes are mixed. Indirect evidence suggests that other executive functions, such as planning or monitoring, may be involved when learning from multiple texts. More research on this topic is needed given the increasing complexity of the contexts in which reading activities take place. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study examined the role of relevance determinations within the context of undergraduates’ multiple text reading and writing. In this study, undergraduate students were randomly assigned to one of two experimental conditions (i.e., to compose a research report about either the causes of or the solutions to the urban housing crisis), using a library of 12 digital texts (six more relevant and six less relevant to students’ assigned task condition). Guided by the Multiple Documents Task-Based Relevance Assessment and Content Extraction (MD-TRACE) model, we identified the key features that students included in their task models, used log data to profile students’ text selection justifications and navigation, and categorized students’ writing as task-relevant or not. As such, we found students’ relevance determinations to play a key role in forming task models prior to text access, selecting and navigating texts during multiple text use, and composing a task product after accessing multiple texts. While we did not find students’ initial task models to be associated with their patterns of text selection justifications or navigation nor with writing performance, we did find differences in writing performance across students belonging to different text selection justification and navigation profiles. Implications for theory and research on learning from multiple texts are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Metacognitive reading strategy instruction is implemented in elementary education to develop proficient independent readers. Self-monitoring reading allows readers to gain control over their comprehension levels and think deeply about text. As elementary teachers provide instruction on metacognitive reading strategies, research must aim to investigate how these strategies are implemented across multiple subject areas. This research study analyzed how metacognitive reading strategies are transferred from literacy instruction to mathematical literacy. Within this study, 102 fifth grade students were surveyed on their use of metacognitive reading strategies when reading a fiction reading passage and math word problems. Participants completed a Metacognitive Strategy Awareness Inventory to report strategy use in fiction and math reading. This research compares and contrast how students utilize reading strategies with fiction texts in comparison to math word problems. The findings of this study showed students are able to transfer metacognitive reading strategies from fiction to mathematics. Students reportedly utilized close reading self-monitoring strategies more frequently when reading math word problems in comparison to fiction. The implications of this study suggest students have the ability to transfer metacognitive reading strategies when they have a foundation of strategy instruction through a curriculum containing multiple text genres. This knowledge will allow reading teachers to recognize the importance of metacognitive strategy instruction for reading and mathematics. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Abstract This study investigated whether task instruction affected comprehension of multiple conflicting-view texts after controlling for a number of individual difference variables and whether the effects of task instruction varied as a result of post-reading assessment tasks. Recruited from a First-Year Composition course, 64 participants received a task instruction that set the goal of seeking an alternative explanation and reframed argument as a process of conversation and exploration. Multiple-text comprehension was measured by a synthesis writing task and an argument writing task. The results showed that participants given the instruction outperformed participants in the control condition, as reflected in their argument writing. Among the control variables, beliefs about argumentation, need for cognition and topic interest were positively correlated with comprehension measures. These results highlight the importance of cultivating divergent thinking of multiple perspectives rather than dichotomous thinking of pros and cons. Pedagogical implications are discussed.

AB  - [Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 34(1) of Educational Psychology Review (see record [rid]2022-33526-004[/rid]). In the original article, in the right panel of Fig. 1, the gray circles representing source credibility of the example sources were mislabeled as 'high' credibility. The correct labels should indicate 'low' credibility because those sources are relatively low credibility compared to the sources included in the left panel. The corrected image appears in the erratum.] The aim of this paper is two-fold. The first aim is to review the core representational and processing aspects of influential accounts of single-document and multiple-document comprehension with a particular emphasis on how readers negotiate conflicting information during reading. This review provides the groundwork for the second aim—to expand our current account of knowledge revision during reading of single documents to multiple documents. The product of this expansion is an initial conceptualization of the Knowledge Revision Components Framework–Multiple Documents (KReC-MD). This initial conceptualization presents the theoretical foundation necessary for future empirical work and further refinement. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Multiple text integration is a challenging task, but it is essential for studying and developing digital literacy, and is therefore critical to promote among students. However, the conditions that may support multiple text integration for different reader profiles have not been thoroughly studied. Therefore, based on single text research, the current study examined whether adding reading comprehension questions in-between texts would improve subsequent text integration for good versus poor readers. Another aim was to assess multiple text integration of complementary texts, where information does not conflict, but supplements, and to examine separately two components of integration: selecting the relevant information and forming inter-text links. Two experiments were carried out: in the first, 124 university students read multiple texts with or without embedded multiple-choice questions. Results showed that adding comprehension questions promoted inter-text links, but hindered references to single text ideas. In the second experiment, 59 university students read multiple texts paired with either open-ended questions or multiple-choice questions embedded between texts. Open-ended questions resulted in higher integration scores compared to multiple-choice questions only among participants with low comprehension scores. Overall, reading comprehension skills uniquely contributed to text integration. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The main goal for the current study was to investigate whether individual differences in domain-general thinking dispositions might affect learning from multiple-document inquiry tasks in science. Middle school students were given a set of documents and were tasked with understanding how and why recent patterns in global temperature might be different from what has been observed in the past from those documents. Understanding was assessed with two measures: an essay task and an inference verification task. Domain-general thinking dispositions were assessed with a Commitment to Logic, Evidence, and Reasoning (CLEAR) thinking scale. The measures of understanding were uniquely predicted by both reading skills and CLEAR thinking scores, and these effects were not attributable to prior knowledge or interest. The results suggest independent roles for thinking dispositions and reading ability when students read to learn from multiple-document inquiry tasks in science. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - We compared high school students’ performance in a traditional comprehension assessment requiring them to identify key information and draw inferences from single texts, and a scenario-based assessment (SBA) requiring them to integrate, evaluate and apply information across multiple sources. Both assessments focused on a non-academic topic. Performance on the two assessments were moderately correlated (r = 0.57), but the SBA was more difficult (Study 1; n = 342). The two assessments similarly depended on basic reading skills but diverged in the relation to academic knowledge and (non-academic) topic knowledge (Study 2; n = 1107). Academic knowledge was highly predictive of traditional comprehension, but less so for SBA. Topic knowledge was more predictive of SBA than traditional comprehension. Thus, the two assessments tap into similar constructs related to comprehension; however, the level of topic knowledge is more important for performance on scenario-based, multiple-source reading tasks, whereas academic knowledge is more important for traditional reading comprehension tasks.

AB  - Recent research suggests that readers' subjective task understanding influences reading processes and outcomes. Therefore, the present study's aim was to investigate whether the task demands that readers retrospectively report relate to multiple document comprehension strategies and outcome. A total of 310 university students completed three units from a standardized multiple-document comprehension test and answered an open-ended task demands question after each unit. Amongst others, participants comprehended single- and multiple-document activities to be task demands. Comprehending deep-level single-document activities and management activities to be task demands related to corroboration and proactive sourcing, respectively. However, comprehending multiple-document activities to be task demands was related neither to students' multiple-document comprehension nor to their realized multiple-document activities. The data suggest a context schema formation across test units: In later units the participants comprehended more often multiple-document activities and less often surface-level single-document and management activities to be task demands, and conducted more sourcing.

AB  - This study addressed whether an application adapted to working with multiple documents implemented in an iPad Pro tablet would promote students’ multiple document comprehension and acceptance of tablets as a multiple document learning tool relative to controls who used a traditional application adapted to sequential reading of single documents. Results indicated that students using the multiple document reading application outperformed the control students in terms of comprehension and also worked more efficiently on the assigned multiple document task, but only if given explicit guidance in selecting, organizing, and integrating information by utilizing the functions of the application. Still, after task completion, the more effective and efficient students guided in using the functions of the multiple document reading application displayed much less acceptance of tablets as a multiple document learning tool than did the control students. We discuss possible explanations for this intriguing performance-acceptance paradox and suggest some avenues for future research in this area.

AB  - In the 'information age,' readers encounter information about socio-scientific issues repeatedly from multiple documents and sources. In turn, this information found across multiple sources may reactivate and strengthen inaccurate prior knowledge or misconceptions. Much existing theoretical and empirical work has examined how readers represent and process multiple documents and sources. Likewise, existing work has also provided an understanding of the conditions that promote the revision of preexisting misconceptions (i.e., knowledge revision) during reading. However, currently lacking is an understanding of how knowledge revision unfolds when readers engage with multiple documents from different sources. To address this gap, I present a new theoretical account that integrates key representational and processing aspects from existing accounts of multiple-document comprehension and sourcing to expand our current understanding of knowledge revision to account for multiple documents and sources (i.e., the Knowledge Revision Components Framework – Multiple Documents; KReC-MD). In a set of two experiments, I tested core hypotheses derived from KReC-MD regarding the influence of text structure, source credibility, and intertextual integration on knowledge revision. In Experiment 1, readers engaged with a set of three documents addressing misconceptions related to genetically modified organisms (GMOs) that varied in text structure (refutation vs. non-refutation) and source credibility (high vs. low). Readers demonstrated superior intertextual integration after engaging with refutation texts, as well as high-credibility sources. In turn, readers who engaged in more intertextual integration demonstrated superior knowledge revision outcomes. In addition to examining knowledge revision outcomes, it was also critical to examine the processes that readers engage in moment-by-moment during reading. Thus, in Experiment 2, I used a typed think-aloud methodology to examine the integration, sourcing, and knowledge revision processes readers engaged in during reading of refutation texts from either high- or low-credibility sources. Readers engaged in more source evaluations in the low-credibility condition, yet they demonstrated superior intertextual integration and knowledge revision in the high-credibility condition. Thus, readers may have engaged in more evaluation of low-credibility sources as a means of subsequently rejecting information from those sources. These results are discussed in light of existing research regarding multiple-document comprehension and sourcing, and critically, are used to refine the initial proposal of KReC-MD and inform future work.

AB  - Abstract Increased amounts of information available from the Internet have triggered new demands for students to evaluate information quality. Our study presents an instructional intervention aimed at fostering ninth grade students' critical evaluation of source reliability. The intervention was grounded into theories of multiple text comprehension and used an analytic framework that defines the core source dimensions of author position (competence), author motivation (intention), and media quality (pre-publication validation). Compared to controls, trained students 1) reduced the score assigned to links containing less reliable information in the three critical source dimensions (knowledge application task), as well as 2) increased the number of references made to a more reliable source (e.g., “ scientific journal ”) and decreased references made to a less reliable source (e.g., “ personal blog ”), in a task presenting contradictory information across texts (transfer task). Nonetheless, the intervention outcomes varied according to the type of source evaluation question. We discuss the beneficial effects of implementing classroom intervention on sourcing skills as a means to improve teenagers’ critical thinking when comprehending multiple documents. Highlights • Teenagers experience difficulties when comprehending multiple documents. • Teenagers' critical thinking can be improved by training sourcing skills. • Trained students rated less reliable information sources more negatively. • Trained students increased references made to more reliable source information. • Intervention benefits varied according to the type of source assessment question.

AB  - Abstract: This study examined implicit theories of intelligence as predictors of multiple document comprehension in a sample of 59 Norwegian upper-secondary school students. In four multiple regression analyses with multiple document comprehension indicated by students' inclusion of scientific concepts in their essays, discrimination between more and less useful documents given the reading task, consideration of document trustworthiness as a basis for making those discriminations, and ability to draw inferences across documents as outcome measures, beliefs in intelligence as a malleable, increasable quality emerged as a unique positive predictor after controlling for word recognition, prior knowledge, and working memory. However, beliefs in intelligence as a fixed, unchangeable quantity did not emerge as a unique negative predictor. The findings indicate that the benefits of endorsing an incremental theory of intelligence may be more pronounced than the costs of endorsing an entity theory of intelligence in complex reading task contexts.

AB  - This study explored the dimensionality of multiple-text comprehension strategies in a sample of 216 Norwegian education undergraduates who read seven separate texts on a science topic and immediately afterwards responded to a self-report inventory focusing on strategic multiple-text processing in that specific task context. Two dimensions were identified through factor analysis: one concerning the accumulation of pieces of information from the different texts and one concerning cross-text elaboration. In a subsample of 71 students who were also administered measures of intratextual and intertextual comprehension after responding to the strategy inventory, hierarchical multiple regression analysis indicated that self-reported accumulation of information and cross-text elaboration explained variance in intertextual comprehension even after variance associated with prior knowledge had been removed.

AB  - This introduction to the special issue entitled 'Mechanisms of Variation in Reading Comprehension: Processes and Products' defines what is referred to as the process and product of reading comprehension. A specific process model is offered, and five articles are discussed referencing it. Key questions are: a) How to study the process and products of reading comprehension?; b) How are the process and product of reading comprehension related?; c) Is reading comprehension (modulo decoding) the same as listening comprehension?; d) Are comprehension processes and products influenced by the same individual differences? Word Knowledge is found to influence both process and product measures of comprehension, but is described as insufficient to account for the full range of variation in reading comprehension. The need for examining complex texts (e.g., expository genre), which require skill in processing infrequent syntactic constructions is emphasized, as well as methods for examining individual differences in multiple-text learning.

AB  - Prior beliefs often bias the comprehension of multiple science-related texts such that belief-consistent texts are better comprehended compared to belief-inconsistent texts (text-belief consistency effect). Two experiments were conducted to investigate whether a metacognitive strategy training focusing on belief-biasing validation processes can reduce the text-belief consistency effect in multiple text comprehension. Participants in the control condition received the PQ4R training as a well-situated and effective reading skill training that increases receptive elaborative processing. In Experiment 1 (n = 39) and Experiment 2 (n = 53) participants receiving a metacognitive strategy training achieved a similar level of comprehension of belief-consistent and belief-inconsistent texts, whereas a text-belief consistency effect was found in the PQ4R condition. These results indicate that a training focusing on belief-biasing validation processes prepare readers for the challenges to comprehend belief-relevant multiple texts, whereas strategies that foster receptive processing of information are not sufficient in the context of controversially discussed topics.

AB  - The constructed responses individuals generate while reading can provide insights into their coherence-building processes. The current study examined how the cohesion of constructed responses relates to performance on an integrated writing task. Participants (N = 95) completed a multiple document reading task wherein they were prompted to think aloud, self-explain, or evaluate the sources while reading and then write an integrated essay based on their reading. Natural Language Processing techniques were used to analyze the cohesion of the constructed responses at both within- and across-text levels. Both within- and across-text cohesion indices were positively related to essay quality; however, across-text cohesion indices exhibited stronger effects. Overall, this study provides evidence that the cohesion of constructed responses can serve as a proxy of the coherence of the mental representations that readers construct during multiple document processing.

AB  - This study investigates the learners' attitudes towards using academic, collaborative and social interaction in e-learning portal environment. Academic interaction consists of interaction between learners and online learning resources such as online reading, online explanation, online examination and also online question answering. Collaborative interaction occurs when learners interact among themselves using online group discussion. Social interaction happens when learners and instructors participate in the session either via online text chatting or voice chatting. The study employed quantitative methodology where data were collected through questionnaire that was administered to 933 distance education students from Bachelor of Management, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Social Science and Bachelor of Art. The survey responses were tabulated in a 5-point Likert scale and analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) Version 12.0 based on frequency and percentage distribution. The result of the study suggested that among three types of interaction, most of the student prefer academic interaction for their learning supports in e-learning portal compared to collaborative and social interaction. They wish to interact with learning content rather than interact with people. They prefer to read and learn from the resources rather than sharing knowledge among themselves and instructors via collaborative and social interaction. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Reports an error in 'KReC-MD: Knowledge revision with multiple documents' by Reese Butterfuss and Panayiota Kendeou (Educational Psychology Review, 2021[Dec], Vol 33[4], 1475-1497). In the original article, in the right panel of Fig. 1, the gray circles representing source credibility of the example sources were mislabeled as 'high' credibility. The correct labels should indicate 'low' credibility because those sources are relatively low credibility compared to the sources included in the left panel. The corrected image appears in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2021-30139-001[/rid]). The aim of this paper is two-fold. The first aim is to review the core representational and processing aspects of influential accounts of single-document and multiple-document comprehension with a particular emphasis on how readers negotiate conflicting information during reading. This review provides the groundwork for the second aim—to expand our current account of knowledge revision during reading of single documents to multiple documents. The product of this expansion is an initial conceptualization of the Knowledge Revision Components Framework–Multiple Documents (KReC-MD). This initial conceptualization presents the theoretical foundation necessary for future empirical work and further refinement. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Text comprehension involves the ability to understand how texts relate to the situation they describe and to each other (i.e., a Document model). Research into Document models has emphasized the role of information sources in structuring readers’ mental models of situations. The present article reviews research on source comprehension and examines new hypotheses regarding source encoding during text comprehension. Two experiments examined college students’ evaluation and recognition of two embedded sources as a function of the consistency of their statements (Experiments 1 and 2) and the demands of the reading task (Experiment 2). Sources were introduced either with a knowledge feature (e.g., how the source knew what they knew) or a control feature. Readers were more likely to select the knowledgeable source as more competent and to justify their selection by referring to the knowledge feature (Experiment 1). Experiment 2 found that readers’ preference for knowledgeable sources was stronger when the content statements were discrepant. Preference for knowledgeable sources was also stronger when the task focused on source knowledge, as compared to a control evaluation task or a baseline reading task. The source knowledge evaluation task distinctively enhanced participants’ integration of the source designations with their respective statements, as compared to the control and baseline conditions. Results are discussed in light of current theories of single and multiple document comprehension. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Few studies have explored how general skills in both reading and writing influence performance on integrated, source-based writing. The goal of the present study was to consider the relative contributions of reading and writing ability on multiple-document integrative reading and writing tasks. Students in the U.S. (n = 94) completed two tasks in which they read text sets about a socioscientific issue, generated constructed responses while reading, and then composed integrated essays. They also completed individual difference measures (general knowledge, reading skill, reading strategy use) and wrote independent essays to assess their writing ability. Mixed effect models revealed that general knowledge and reading skills contributed to integrated essay performance, but that once general writing ability was entered into the model, it became the strongest predictor of integrated writing scores. These results suggest the need for deeper consideration of the role of writing skills in integrated reading and writing tasks. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This article reviews how individual differences have been conceptualized and researched within the area of multiple document literacy, in particular the extent to which proposed relationships between individual differences and the multiple document literacy process of sourcing have been supported by the empirical research. The findings showed that although the majority of the individual differences included in theoretical models of multiple document literacy have been researched, the empirical backing of proposed relationships is rather ambiguous. Still, in-depth analyses of the most researched individual differences in relation to sourcing revealed some interesting and interpretable patterns. Further, the review suggested that relationships between individual differences and sourcing may vary not only with the way sourcing is measured but also with the domain or topic addressed in the reading materials. We discuss the current status of research on individual differences in the context of multiple document literacy with a focus on sourcing and suggest potential avenues for further clarifications.

AB  - To extend the existing research examining multiple text comprehension and its assessment, we developed a verification task approach to assessing of information that was explicitly and implicitly presented within and across nine texts. A nonparametric form of signal detection theory was used to analyse the performance of 47 middle school students using a rating response scale to judge the truth value of specific statements. The results showed that the four types of statements in the verification task (explicit and implicit; within- and across- text) behaved systematically: within-text explicit statements were the easiest for students to verify as true and across-text implicit statements were the most difficult. Practical implications of these results regarding assessment of complex comprehension processes are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - With the fast-paced development of technology in today’s society, there has been emerging a shift from paper-based reading to digital online reading. While the benefits of exposure to print have been well-established in previous studies, how online reading may impact individuals’ literacy development is largely underexplored. The current study investigated if the amount of English reading experience on the Internet could predict EFL students’ lexical knowledge and reading comprehension ability. Participants were ninety-seven Vietnamese undergraduate students who were administered a website checklist and a vocabulary size test. Their reading comprehension scores were also collected as measures of their reading abilities. Descriptive statistics, hierarchical linear regression and structural equation modelling were utilized for data analysis. The results indicated that exposure to L2 online text was a significant predictor of the participants’ vocabulary size as well as their reading comprehension growth during a course of two years. Pedagogical implications are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The purpose of this study was to test the relationships between critical thinking, prior topic knowledge and beliefs, and multiple-document comprehension through a path analysis approach. The participants were 281 Italian undergraduate students. Participants first completed a rational-experiential inventory, a critical thinking skills test, a prior topic knowledge test, and a prior topic beliefs test. Then, they were asked to read six documents on the topic of flu vaccination. After reading the texts, students were asked to write an argumentative essay on the topic as a measure of multiple-document comprehension. The hypothesized model fit the data well. Results confirmed that argumentation quality after reading six documents with different perspectives on the topic is associated with different critical thinking skills in stronger- versus weaker-belief readers. In weaker-belief readers, multiple-document comprehension was associated with deduction skills, whereas in stronger-belief readers, multiple-document comprehension was associated with hypothesis-testing skills. Both theoretical and educational implications of the results are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Children's comprehension of single texts relies on both foundational and higher‐level skills. These are also assumed to support multiple‐document comprehension, but their relative importance has not been examined, to date. Multiple‐document comprehension additionally requires the identification and use of information about each document's source. Aims: This study examined multiple‐document comprehension in primary school‐aged children. It sought to determine the relative importance of skills proposed to be common to both single‐text and multiple‐document comprehension (word reading fluency, verbal working memory, comprehension monitoring) and specific to the latter (source use). Single‐text comprehension and prior topic knowledge were considered as moderator and control. Sample: Participants were 94 children in the fourth year (mean age = 9; 7 years; 52% females). Methods: Children read three documents on each of two topics (chocolate and video games). Multiple‐document comprehension and source use were assessed through short essays. Independent measures of the fundamental and higher‐level skills were used. Results: There was a significant direct and indirect influence of word reading fluency on comprehension of multiple documents on videogames and also an indirect influence of comprehension monitoring. Indirect influences of word reading fluency and comprehension monitoring on multiple‐document comprehension for both topics were also apparent. Verbal working memory was not a unique predictor. When source information was identified, it was included to support the argument in the composition. Conclusions: Efficient word reading, comprehension monitoring, and single‐text comprehension are important for multiple‐document comprehension in young readers. Implications of these findings and differences between the two document sets are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - We examined students' understanding of the causes of a scientific phenomenon from a multiple-document-inquiry unit. Students read several documents that each described causal factors that could be integrated to address the given writing task of explaining the causes of change in average global temperature. We manipulated whether the document set included a document that took a position on climate change policies and whether a reading/writing prompt focused only on understanding the causes (“explain how and why recent temperature changes are occurring”) or also included a solution-related addendum (“and what we can do about it”). The results suggest that including a policy-related document can lead to poorer learning outcomes for the causes of climate change, with evidence that students focused on policy in lieu of, rather than in relation to, a causal understanding of the issue.

AB  - Executive functions (EF) have been theoretically implicated in multiple text comprehension. Yet, the contributions of EFs to comprehension and integration of multiple texts have not been tested empirically, and instructional supports for text integration grounded in EFs are only beginning to be developed. Using a conflicting-text paradigm, this study examined the roles of EFs, based on measures of learners’ reported EF use and EF skills, and a text-embedded intervention, designed to elicit readers’ EF and metacognitive engagement, in comprehension–integration of conflicting informational texts. Structural equation modeling was employed to test a proposed indirect effects model in which EF use and skills and the text intervention condition predicted comprehension–integration, both directly and via reported cross-text elaboration; academic achievement was controlled. Learners’ reported EF use contributed directly and indirectly to learners’ comprehension–integration of the conflicting texts; EF skills, based on a measure of verbal fluency, contributed only indirectly to comprehension–integration. The effect of condition on comprehension–integration was transmitted entirely through learners’ reported use of cross-text elaboration strategies. The model explained 15% and 16% of the variance in reported cross-text elaboration and comprehension–integration, respectively, suggesting moderate effects of EFs and the brief, text-embedded intervention on comprehension–integration of the texts. Empirical and theoretical implications are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study investigated the contribution of both physiological and behavioural process data to the comprehension of conflicting digital texts. We measured skin conductance level (SCL) as an index of arousal and the first‐pass and look‐back fixation times as indices of visual behaviour while reading. Forty‐eight seventh graders read four webpages on genetically modified food, and their comprehension of the texts was measured using a short essay. Results showed that the type of webpage did not differentiate the process data. Statistical procedures for the comparison of a series of regression models revealed that SCL and first‐pass fixation time negatively predicted multiple‐text comprehension while also considering the control variables. The more the students were aroused while reading and the longer the processing time during the first encounter with the reading material, the poorer their comprehension of the conflicting texts. However, the interaction of prior knowledge and arousal positively predicted multiple‐text comprehension. A slope analysis revealed that when participants had high prior knowledge and high arousal during reading, their postreading comprehension performance increased.

AB  - To improve students’ reasoning about text-based evidence, in two studies, we examine the effects of a brief intervention (i.e., Evidence-Based Reasoning, EBR) on students’ evidence identification, as determined by their performance on an objective evidence identification (EID) task, and their evaluation, selection, and ultimate use of evidence in writing. In Study 1, we found that the EBR intervention effectively improved students’ identification of different types of evidence (e.g., anecdotal, descriptive). Moreover, students with higher prior knowledge benefited more from the intervention. Study 2 aimed to replicate Study 1, and to further examine whether the positive effects of the EBR intervention manifested when students completed a multiple text reading-writing task. The effects of the EBR intervention on students’ evidence identification were replicated in Study 2. Nevertheless, this positive effect did not transfer to students’ completion of a multiple text reading-writing task. In contrast to Study 1, students with lower prior knowledge benefited more from the intervention in Study 2. Students’ evidence evaluation and their selection and inclusion of evidence in writing did not differ across EBR intervention and control conditions, suggesting directions for future work.

AB  - Background: Reading researchers have generally considered that reading is an interactive combination of top-down (higher-level language skill) and bottom-up (lower-level language skill) processes. Nevertheless, the mechanisms through which readers apply these skills for online text comprehension are unclear. Methods: The present study thus used eight classical Chinese (CC) texts and their corresponding vernacular translation (VT) texts for controlling the text structure and meaning to explore such mechanisms in high school students. Results: With partial-out to the influences of (a) students’ language achievement scores, (b) word frequency and (c) word length, we observed no significant difference in comprehension accuracy between the CC and VT texts, and the CC texts involved a significantly lower reading speed than did the VT texts. Moreover, the first fixation duration, gaze duration, rereading time and total reading time for the CC texts were longer than those for the VT texts. For all events, CC text reading required a longer fixation duration and significantly longer rereading time and total reading time than did VT text reading. Further observations show that students comprehended CC texts by adjusting their lower- and higher-level language skills. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that even if CC texts contain a relatively high number of low-frequency words, as readers get more and more contextual information from the text, they can gradually apply higher-level reading skills to understand the meaning of the text, which can ease the dependence on word decoding.

AB  - This study presents a descriptive analysis of 71 videotaped lessons taught by 34 highly regarded secondary English language arts, history, and science teachers, collected to inform an intervention focused on evidence-based argumentation from multiple text sources. Studying the practices of highly regarded teachers is valuable for identifying promising practices and stubborn obstacles to reform. We found that although these highly regarded teachers allocated 3 times more class time to working with text than to teacher lecture and explanation, opportunities to engage in text-based argumentation with multiple sources were rare. Furthermore, less than a 3rd of the time allocated to working with text engaged students in actively making meaning from text. When literacy tasks did occur, they were associated with a disciplinary knowledge focus, challenging the notion that literacy activity occurs at the expense of content instruction. Close reading and cross-textual analysis frequently co-occurred with each other and with argumentation, which suggests that intervention designs should foreground these building blocks of argumentation. Disciplinary differences in opportunity to learn indicate that norms of instruction may carry greater weight than disciplinary norms of reasoning and discourse, which suggests that a particular focus on transforming literacy instruction in science may be warranted.

AB  - Constructing a knowledge representation from multiple texts requires the integration of information across texts. The aim of the current study was to investigate how elementary school students integrate information across multiple text passages and, particularly, whether students use information from a prior text to improve understanding of a current text. A sample of 105 children in grades 4 and 6 participated in the experiment. The multiple-text integration paradigm was used to study integration processes across texts during reading. Recall and (application) questions were used to investigate the extent to which information from different text passages was integrated into knowledge representations after reading. Individual differences in reading comprehension ability and working memory were also considered. The results indicate that children in both grades spontaneously activate information from an earlier text to aid their understanding during reading, and that they integrate information across texts in their knowledge representations. This was the case regardless of grade or individual differences in reading-comprehension ability and working memory. These findings provide insight into the mechanisms that may be involved in the integration of information across texts. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Multiple document comprehension (MDC) refers to the ability to integrate information from multiple sources into a coherent representation, which requires specific cognitive processes. Assuming that epistemic beliefs are domain-related, this study investigates exploratively how epistemic beliefs in the domains of science and history affect the mastery of cognitive requirements in domain-general MDC (e.g. the comparison of source information). 156 university students reported their epistemic beliefs in physics or history and completed a computer-based test measuring their MDC. The results showed that MDC was significantly predicted by the epistemic beliefs dimension of personal justification in physics. A conservative approach revealed no interaction effects between epistemic beliefs and the mastery of specific cognitive requirements but results of a liberal approach hinted at associations with epistemic beliefs in physics rather than history. The results are discussed with respect to the nature of epistemic beliefs and theoretical assumptions regarding their relations to MDC requirements. • Epistemic beliefs are supposed to affect multiple document comprehension (MDC). • Personal justification beliefs in physics relate to MDC. • This was the only significant effect under the conservative approach. • A liberal approach shows that beliefs in physics affect information-integration items. • Domain-related epistemic beliefs can partly predict domain-general MDC.

AB  - This study examined the contribution of advanced theory of mind (AToM), operationalized as second- or higher-order recursive mentalistic reasoning, to multiple-text comprehension in fourth and fifth graders (N = 184). The role of AToM was analyzed by taking into account children’s individual characteristics (i.e., age, gender, prior topic knowledge, word reading fluency, vocabulary knowledge, and single-text comprehension) and task features (i.e., contrast between positions on the topic of two sets of texts). Mixed models analysis revealed that AToM uniquely contributed to comprehension of multiple texts over and above the individual and task variables. In addition, the contribution of AToM to the comprehension of multiple texts did not significantly differ for the two tasks despite differences in contrast between positions on the topic. Results indicate that children’s ability to consider different perspectives and mental states is a relevant unique predictor of multiple-text comprehension.

AB  - Starting with early research on multiple source comprehension that primarily emerged from work in history, researchers have explored several types of instructional manipulations including altering the features of the inquiry task that is given (such as being asked to write a narrative or an argument); changing features of the task environment (such as the format of the source documents or features of the document set); and varying the instructional context (such as having students engage in a particular activity or training prior to engaging in a multiple-source inquiry task). These three broad categories continue to represent the main types of manipulations that have been studied as this literature has expanded to also include explorations into the comprehension of scientific phenomena from multiple-source inquiry tasks. This chapter provides an overview discussing the kinds of processes that are theoretically involved in multiple-source comprehension; articulates the challenges that readers face when they attempt to engage in multiple-source inquiry tasks; and summarizes the empirical research that has attempted to explore multiple source comprehension processes using manipulations of the inquiry task, the task environment, and the instructional context.

AB  - ABSTRACT This study investigated multimodal multiple text comprehension (MMTC) among forty-eight Taiwanese university students, considering their cognitive and affective characteristics. A randomized trial with pre- and post-tests design was applied. The experiment group received a browser-embedded note-taking device along with epistemic prompting. The control group was provided with the browser-embedded note-taking device only. The results showed that situational interest, prior knowledge level, and cognitive load were associated with learners’ MMTC. Besides, prior knowledge and cognitive load moderated the effect of epistemic prompting on MMTC. Students with low prior knowledge scored significantly lower in MMTC without graphics than those with medium or high prior knowledge in the control group. Moreover, the cognitive load had a stronger negative influence on participants’ MMTC without graphics in the control group, but the negative impact was negligible on those in the experimental group. The contributions and implications of the findings were discussed regarding the MMTC intervention and instruction. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Research into discourse synthesis examines the ways in which writers make use of, and transform, multiple other texts in writing their own. It is intertextual research that has blurred boundaries of various kinds, not only the boundary between the processes of reading and writing but also boundaries across disciplines as well as regions of the world. Guided by a cognitive constructivist perspective, this research into discourse synthesis drew at its origin—and continues to draw now—from multidisciplinary theoretical and empirical work. This article, which establishes the foundations for this research and traces its development, attends to writers’ transformations of multiple source texts resulting from operations of organizing, selecting, and connecting. Studies into synthesis writing for varying academic tasks have shown that, by applying these operations to multiple textual sources, writers produce discourses that function as new texts in new contexts. Following a discussion of historical background, attention in this article goes to three major issues: the variation in synthesis associated with different academic genres; the kinds of insights into product and process that come from different research approaches; and the nature of new instructional approaches that emphasize elements of discourse synthesis. All facets of this research reveal continuity as well as change, the latter occurring, in large part, through contact and convergence of discourse synthesis research with related bodies of work. The conclusion, which centers on the notion of transformation, summarizes research conducted thus far and points to future directions. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - We structure our lives around social groups – belonging to them and thinking about them. In this dissertation, I develop a new stereotype content measure to assess the attributes associated with groups in America today, propose and support a theory of sociocultural essentialism, and explore the strategic activation of sociocultural essentialism among members of marginalized groups. Together, these studies contribute to psychological research on the relationship between ontological belief and stereotyping, and their functions in society today.In the first chapter, I comprehensively update the adjective checklist, an existing measure to assess stereotype content about different groups in American society today. I first discuss the affordances and critiques of the measure and conduct a narrative review of its history, before generating a new measure integrating content from in-lab and online text sources. I then gather and use norming data to pick the best set of terms for inclusion in the measure and validate the resulting list.In the second chapter, I use the new adjective checklist measure to test the theory of sociocultural essentialism. I argue that existing research on essentialist beliefs about social categories have over-emphasized biogenetic beliefs and that the perception of shared social experience or common fate may similarly ground essentialist perceptions. I update an existing experimental task to test this proposition across six social domains, asking participants to attribute traits to an individual who had switched between two social groups in a given domain. Findings support the existence of sociocultural essentialist reasoning while also showing that participants' ideas about the process of switching groups impacted attributions beyond the stereotype of each group.In the third chapter, I explore the role of sociocultural essentialism among members of marginalized groups. With LGB+ participants, I test whether reminders of group devaluation and group denial change levels of sociocultural and biogenetic essentialist thinking and whether changes in essentialist beliefs predict ingroup attitudes or support for policy change. Though the experimental manipulation failed to produce the expected differences in essentialist thinking, I discuss correlational and exploratory results suggesting that biogenetic and sociocultural essentialism play distinct roles in this population, and that reminders of group denial produce sociocultural essentialism among younger participants, while reminders of group devaluation do so among older participants. Finally, I review the three chapters and suggest future avenues for development of the research program. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study collected teacher perspectives on the impact of mandated high-stakes online testing to identify current needs for teachers and students regarding the development of student technology skills for such assessments. Participants included 41 teachers who instruct students in 3rd, 4th, or 5th grade in any capacity from ten school districts in central New Jersey. A mixed-methods design provided data in the form of an online survey complemented by interviews with nine teachers from online survey participants.No teachers feel that all their students have mastered any of the skills pertinent to high-stakes online testing. Forty-three percent of all participants still feel that fewer than half of their students are prepared to demonstrate what they know in high-stakes online assessment platforms. This finding is critical because even though it has been 5 years since the initial mandate, this testing platform necessitates both students and teachers develop technology skills and classroom integrated practices needed to allow students to utilize the testing platform in high-stakes mandated assessments tacitly.Teachers felt that many, if not all, students still need to develop skills, including keyboarding, typing math expressions, reading online text, and writing online. Teachers feel that there is a need for time to engage in technology professional development. The preferred venue choice is participating in a presentation/workshop with an in district mentor/coach available after the presentation. It is understood that technology is not going away, and beginner technology skills are not inherent. Young students need to be taught these skills the same way they are taught skills with paper and pencil before applying them. Individual school districts need to work together to identify and plan for the best way to integrate the technology skills development of students, especially those with special needs, across all content areas.

AB  - A key challenge of fostering digital literacy is developing learners' ability to construct knowledge from information sources that present diverse viewpoints. This study investigated the relation between learners' epistemic perspectives and their comprehension of authors' viewpoints. Additionally, the study examined if epistemic perspectives and viewpoint comprehension predict information source integration and explored how epistemic perspectives moderate the impact of conflicts on viewpoint comprehension. 170 participants responded to an epistemic thinking assessment, read conflicting or converging blog-posts regarding a socio-scientific controversy, wrote arguments, and completed tasks assessing viewpoint comprehension. Absolutism and multiplism were found to be negative predictors and evaluativism a positive predictor of viewpoint comprehension. Viewpoint comprehension mediated the relation between epistemic perspectives and information source integration in written arguments. Conflicts between sources improved viewpoint comprehension only in high levels of multiplism and evaluativism. The findings advance the understanding of the relation between learners' epistemic thinking and multiple document comprehension. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The present study investigated the influence of the source of information on high-school students' identification of contradictions within online science texts. A pilot study with N = 92 high-school students showed that their expectations regarding the quality of an online text differed significantly depending on the type of the source (i.e., on the authoritativeness of the website and the author's expertise). In the main study N = 161 high-school students read a science text that contained four text-internal contradictions and that varied regarding the authoritativeness of the website on which the text was presented (authoritative vs. non-authoritative website) and the author of the text (expert vs. layperson). After reading, a Conflict Verification Task (CVT) was applied to measure students' identification of the conflicting information. The results indicate that students' identification of contradictions differs as a function of website authoritativeness and author expertise. Both in a text stemming from an unambiguously authoritative source (“expert author/authoritative website”) and in a text stemming from an unambiguously non-authoritative source (“lay author/non-authoritative website”) students identified more contradictions than in a text stemming from a source whose authoritativeness is ambiguous (“lay author/authoritative website” or “expert author/non-authoritative website”).

AB  - Comprehension substantially benefits from attending to, thinking about, and mentally representing the sources of any presented information. Such processes require mental effort and unfortunately people do not always engage in such activities. The current article presents a nascent, evolving model of discourse comprehension that formalizes mechanisms to predict and explain people’s strategic use of source information. The discrepancy-induced source comprehension (D-ISC) model and its theoretical assumptions describe the moment-by-moment cognitive processes in which readers engage when they interact with potentially contradictory or controversial messages presented by different information sources. The utility of the model is supported by evidence from a growing research base examining single- and multiple-text comprehension experiences. The D-ISC model is also useful for suggesting future directions that could help build more-nuanced understandings of the ways that diverse readers engage in sourcing activities within everyday discourse contexts.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate psychophysiological responses while reading multiple webpages on a debated topic. We measured heart rate (HR) as an index of emotional arousal and heart rate variability (HRV) as an index of emotional regulation. Forty-seven lower secondary school students in grade 7 read four webpages varying for reliability and position on the topic of the potential health risks associated with the use of mobile phones, while their cardiac activity was registered. Post-reading performance of multiple-text comprehension at intertextual level was measured by an essay, which was coded for sourcing (reference to the source information and connection with its content) and argumentation on the topic. Results showed that the type of webpage did not differentiate HR and HRV while reading. However, HR and HRV predicted comprehension across texts as reflected in argumentation, after controlling for prior knowledge and reading comprehension. Specifically, HR was a negative predictor and HRV a positive predictor; the less the students were emotionally reactive to the content read and the more they were able to self-regulate while reading, the greater their multiple-text comprehension, such as the ability to argue about the debated topic. Theoretical and practical contributions of the study are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - College students often struggle to learn from multiple documents without instructional support. Previous research suggests that self-questioning strategies can aid comprehension and that questions aimed at multiple documents can support multiple document learning. Multiple Document Question Instruction (MDQI) was developed to teach students how to generate highquality questions to support multiple document learning. A prior study tested the effects of this instruction, in which experimental participants received MDQI after reading the texts. Although positive effects of instruction were found, effects were small. The current study replicates that study, but includes a third condition in which participants receive MDQI before reading the documents. Findings suggest MDQI supports the learner's abilities to generate high-quality questions and that the generation of such questions, apart from condition, does have a moderate effect on multiple document learning. While there were significant effects of condition on question generation, there were no significant condition effects on multiple document learning. There was an important pattern, however, in that MDQI before reading performed worse than both MDQI after reading and control conditions on a measure of multiple document integration and learning, contrary to expectations. Implications for further development of MDQI, educational use, and future research are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The Common Core State Standards (CCSS) for ELA/Literacy, and the standardized assessments that test students on these standards, focus on students' ability to navigate online text and require students to comprehend, analyze, and make inferences about complex texts in both print and digital format. While the ability to read digital text with a high level of comprehension is necessary for 21st Century learners, the transition from reading printed text to reading digital forms of text has posed new challenges for novice readers in learning to execute the processes of deep reading that promote comprehension (Singer & Alexander, 2017). The purpose of this phenomenological study was to identify teachers' perceptions of the effectiveness of strategies and practices utilized by high-performing schools to build comprehension of digital text and prepare their students for online testing in English Language Arts. Twenty elementary school teachers were identified through social media as meeting the criteria for a purposeful sampling of educators who provided ELA/Literacy instruction in high performing schools during the 2016-2017 school year. Research results, obtained through In-depth Individual Interviews (IDI), indicated that providing reading instruction in print and online, as well as facilitating conversations about text, providing opportunities for instruction and practice of close reading strategies, writing responses to text, and taking practice assessments can build the deep reading skills necessary for success in reading deeply and testing in online formats.

AB  - This paper discusses the skills required for students to be able to access, comprehend and use documents independently, both in print and online. We start with a simple example in order to illustrate the demands posed by document-based school tasks on students’ reading literacy skills. We then propose a descriptive framework to broaden the construct of reading literacy so as to account for document processes, including search, evaluation and multiple-text integration. We review some studies illustrating the challenges of these processes for primary school students, and we discuss extant research investigating the effectiveness of instructional interventions.

AB  - Despite advanced and evolving research on the complex strategic decision-making demanded of successful online 21st century learners, many individuals lack requisite knowledge and skills to enact effective strategies, to make inferences, or to engage in self-testing. Researchers across theories and disciplines (e.g., New Literacies, Educational Psychology, and Multiple Source Use) have captured the complex intersection of cognition, metacognition, and motivation associated with learning online. Notably, few researchers have integrated traditional literacy elements related to the structure and function of texts with research on online learning. In particular, there is a need to integrate self-regulated learning literature with research on metatextual knowledge and knowledge of text types and structural features, within online learning environments.In this study, I applied think-aloud protocol data analysis to examine how metatextual knowledge and self-regulated learning processes related to online comprehension. Using 53 university participants, I explored the following: what kinds of metatextual knowledge were displayed during a complex online science task, the relationship between metatextual knowledge and learning gain, and how self-regulated learning processing varied across text types (e.g., argumentation, refutation). Results indicated the following: (a) learners enacted different processes related to structural and organizational functions of text (b) frequency of use of bold headings statistically significantly related to learning, and (c) a combination of metatextual variables, such as using headings to determine the expectation of the adequacy of content, and noticing lists, statistically significantly related to learning. Further, participants statistically significantly differed in their frequency of self-regulated learning processes (e.g., planning, monitoring, and strategy use) across different text types. Findings from this study align with previous traditional literacy research showing the awareness of structural components of text types related to learners' ability to organize information into main ideas that aid comprehension (Akhondi, Malayeri, & Samad, 2011; Dymock, 2000; Roehling, Hebert, Nelson, & Bohaty, 2017; Wijeckumar, Meyer & Rei, 2012), retention, and recall (Richgels, McGee, Lomax & Shield, 1987). Results implicated potential avenues for more research, including continued exploration of self-regulated learning processes and strategies related to different text types and structural components of online learning. In addition, this study further illustrated the utility of think-aloud protocols as an approach to understanding self-regulated learning in context.

AB  - This study examined how the epistemic prompts designed to activate learners' epistemic cognition in sourcing affect their multimodal multiple-document reading (MMDR), considering learners' justification for knowing behaviors, prior knowledge, and gender. Participants were 48 university students, 28 females (58.3%), and 20 males (42.7%). Students were randomly assigned to an experimental group with epistemic-prompts that automatically generate a reflection report in addition to a note-taking function or a control group with a note-taking function only. Results showed that students relied primarily on YouTube videos for their MMDR with higher credibility ratings for the YouTube video than written texts. Besides, epistemic prompting, along with the automatically generated reflection report, enhanced students' scores on constructed-response items for the experimental group and helped them create a coherent mental representation of information from diverse multimodal sources beyond the effect of personal justification and multiple justifications. Implications of the study results are made to enhance students' epistemic cognition during their MMDR. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Dyslexia is one of the most common developmental disabilities; it is a disorder manifested by difficulty in learning to read despite conventional instruction, adequate intelligence, and sociocultural opportunity. The current study focuses on the potential benefits of the use of information and communication technology (ICT) to support children with dyslexia in reading. This paper addresses the need for dyslexia-friendly online text by introducing a dyslexia-friendly font for Arabic scripts called Arabolexia. An important question is asked which is ‘Is Arabolexia font an effective reading aid for children with dyslexia?’ In this work, the author presents the first study that measures the impact of a dyslexia-friendly font for Arabic scripts on reading performance of native Arabic speakers. Fifty-two students aging between 8 and 26 years old were participated in this study. Descriptive and deductive statistical analysis showed that Arabolexia font has an impact on the reading accuracy of children with dyslexia.

AB  - The digital revolution has made a multitude of text documents from highly diverse perspectives on almost any topic easily available. Accordingly, the ability to integrate and evaluate information from different sources, known as multiple document comprehension, has become increasingly important. Because multiple document comprehension requires the integration of content and source information across texts, it is assumed to exceed the demands of single text comprehension due to the inclusion of two additional mental representations: the integrated situation model and the intertext model. To date, there is little empirical evidence on commonalities and differences between single text and multiple document comprehension. Although the relationships between single text and multiple document comprehension can be well distinguished conceptually, there is a lack of empirical studies supporting these assumptions. Therefore, we investigated the dimensional structure of single text and multiple document comprehension with similar test setups. We examined commonalities and differences between the two forms of text comprehension in terms of their relations to final school exam grades, level of university studies and university performance. Using a sample of n = 501 students from two German universities, we jointly modeled single text and multiple document comprehension and applied a series of regression models. Concerning the relationship between single text and multiple document comprehension, confirmatory dimensionality analyses revealed the best fit for a model with two separate factors (latent correlation: 0.84) compared to a two-dimensional model with cross-loadings and fixed covariance between the latent factors and a model with a general factor. Accordingly, the results indicate that single text and multiple document comprehension are separable yet correlated constructs. Furthermore, we found that final school exam grades, level of university studies and prior university performance statistically significant predicted both single text and multiple document comprehension and that expected future university performance was predicted by multiple document comprehension. There were also statistically significant relationships between multiple document comprehension and these variables when single text comprehension was taken into account. The results imply that multiple document comprehension is a construct that is closely related to single text comprehension yet empirically differs from it.

AB  - Abstract: Using cluster-analysis in a sample of 65 Norwegian 10th graders, we identified subgroups characterized by relatively high levels of knowledge combined with relatively low beliefs in personal justification of knowledge claims, as well as subgroups characterized by the opposite pattern of knowledge and personal justification. Moreover, the high knowledge/low personal justification groups differed with respect to the strengths of their beliefs in justification by authority and justification by multiple sources. After having read multiple conflicting texts on a science topic, the majority of students increased their knowledge about the topic and lowered their beliefs in personal justification, combining this pattern with higher beliefs in either justification by authority or justification by multiple sources. The subgroup characterized by relatively high level of knowledge and relatively low level of personal justification in combination with strong beliefs in justification by multiple sources performed best on a multiple-text comprehension measure. Theoretical and educational implications of the study are discussed. [Copyright &y& Elsevier]

AB  - Multiple document comprehension (MDC) is defined as the ability to construct an integrated representation based on different sources of information on a particular topic. It is an important competence for both the successful accomplishment of university studies and participation in societal discussions. Yet, there is no established assessment instrument for MDC. Therefore, we developed a test covering four theory-based cognitive requirements of MDC. Based on the data of 310 university students of social sciences and humanities, the MDC test proved to be a unidimensional measure. Furthermore, the test score was related to the final school exam grade, the study level (bachelor/master), and the performance in an essay task. The empirical results suggest that the score of the MDC test can be interpreted as the generic competence of university students to understand multiple documents (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)
AB  - Das Verständnis multipler Dokumente (Multiple Document Comprehension, MDC) wird als Fähigkeit verstanden, aus verschiedenen Informationsquellen eine integrierte Repräsentation eines inhaltlichen Gegenstandsbereichs zu konstruieren. Als solche ist sie sowohl für die erfolgreiche Bewältigung eines Studiums als auch für gesellschaftliche Partizipation eine wichtige Kompetenz. Bislang gibt es jedoch kein etabliertes Diagnostikum in diesem Bereich. Um diese Lücke zu schließen, wurde ein Test entwickelt, der vier zentrale kognitive Anforderungen von MDC abdeckt und auf Basis der Daten von 310 Studierenden sozial- und geisteswissenschaftlicher Fächer überprüft wurde. Die im MDC-Test gemessene Kompetenz erwies sich als eindimensional. Der MDC-Testwert wies theoriekonforme Zusammenhänge mit der Abiturnote, dem Studienabschnitt und der Leistung in einer Essay-Aufgabe auf. Insgesamt liefern die Ergebnisse empirische Belege dafür, dass der Testwert aus dem MDC-Test die fächerübergreifende Fähigkeit von Studierenden wiedergibt, multiple Dokumente zu verstehen.

AB  - Despite the importance of source attention and evaluation for learning from texts, little is known about the particular conditions that encourage sourcing during reading. In this article, basic assumptions of the discrepancy-induced source comprehension (D-ISC) model are presented, which describes the moment-by-moment cognitive processes that readers undergo when reading-to-understand controversial messages. We then review supporting evidence from single and multiple text comprehension research. In the discussion, we draw conclusions based on the theoretical and empirical research, highlight limitations of what is known to date, and suggest how further investigations of D-ISC might address these concerns.

AB  - Multiple text comprehension can greatly benefit from paying attention to sources and from using this information for evaluating text information. Previous research based on texts from the domain of history suggests that source-related strategies are acquired as part of the discipline expertise as opposed to the spontaneous use of these strategies by students just entering a field. In the present study, we compared the performance of students and scientists in the domain of psychology with regard to (a) their knowledge of publication types, (b) relevant source characteristics, (c) their use of sources for evaluating the credibility of multiple texts, and (d) their ability to judge the plausibility of argumentative statements in psychological texts. Participants worked on a battery of newly developed computerised tests with a think-aloud instruction to uncover strategies that scientists and students used when reading a text. Results showed that scientists scored higher in all of the assessed abilities and that these abilities were positively correlated with each other. Importantly, the superior performance of scientists in evaluating the credibility of multiple texts was mediated by their use of source information. Implications are discussed in terms of discipline expertise.

AB  - Students perform poorly on multiple text reading-writing (MTRW) tasks. To address this issue, we examine students' strategy engagement during response composition by analyzing five types of data. These include: (a) log data of text access, (b) the notes that students composed during processing, (c) students' modified think-aloud reports, (d) screen-capture videos of writing behaviors, and (e) the written products generated. We report on insights gained by coordinating and juxtaposing these various sources of data on students' writing. Results showed that while students accessed and took notes on the majority of the texts provided, information from texts was rarely connected, neither in students' notes nor in the written responses composed. Moreover, students' effortful engagement in multiple text use, captured via log data, was associated with task performance. Finally, a number of variables, corresponding to students’ strategy reports during processing, were found to be significant predictors of writing performance.

AB  - Individual differences in epistemic dispositions may affect learning from multiple-document inquiry tasks by prompting different students to have different task and activity models. Students with epistemic beliefs that are more appropriate for the required activities may view a multiple-document inquiry task as an exercise in corroboration, seeking coherence, and looking for evidence to support claims, whereas students with less-appropriate epistemic beliefs may see the goal as simply finding the 'right' answer verbatim within the documents. This paper describes attempts to develop an assessment for this subset of epistemic beliefs about the value of engaging in integration of evidence when learning from multiple documents in history. Across three experiments, the measure was shown to be reliable and valid. It also uniquely predicted multiple-document comprehension in history above and beyond beliefs about the simplicity and certainty of knowledge, and accounted for differences in prior instruction and experience with document-based questions.

AB  - Learning from multiple documents places high demands on students' reading skills. As a result, an increasing number of intervention procedures aiming at improving the skills of multiple document comprehension have recently been devised. The goal of the present chapter is, first, to introduce the skills necessary to learn from multiple documents. In so doing, we also delineate the difficulties that learners at different age levels experience. We then give an overview of the existing instructional interventions designed to promote these skills. In so doing, we shall highlight the extent to which the interventions are successful in terms of having learners execute learning strategies on their own volition. We thus seek to study the focal question of how instruction may promote spontaneous use of learning strategies in an applied context: learning from multiple documents.

AB  - Combining EEG with eye-tracking is a promising approach to study neural correlates of natural vision, but the resulting recordings are also heavily contaminated by activity of the eye balls, eye lids, and extraocular muscles. While Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is commonly used to suppress these ocular artifacts, its performance under free viewing conditions has not been systematically evaluated and many published reports contain residual artifacts. Here I evaluated and optimized ICA-based correction for two tasks with unconstrained eye movements: visual search in images and sentence reading. In a first step, four parameters of the ICA pipeline were varied orthogonally: the (1) high-pass and (2) low-pass filter applied to the training data, (3) the proportion of training data containing myogenic saccadic spike potentials (SP), and (4) the threshold for eye tracker-based component rejection. In a second step, the eye-tracker was used to objectively quantify the correction quality of each ICA solution, both in terms of undercorrection (residual artifacts) and overcorrection (removal of neurogenic activity). As a benchmark, results were compared to those obtained with an alternative spatial filter, Multiple Source Eye Correction (MSEC). With commonly used settings, Infomax ICA not only left artifacts in the data, but also distorted neurogenic activity during eye movement-free intervals. However, correction results could be strongly improved by training the ICA on optimally filtered data in which SPs were massively overweighted. With optimized procedures, ICA removed virtually all artifacts, including the SP and its associated spectral broadband artifact from both viewing paradigms, with little distortion of neural activity. It also outperformed MSEC in terms of SP correction. Matlab code is provided. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - To make sense of informational texts it is often necessary to grasp their authors’ perspectives and how these underlie the presentation of information. Comprehending source perspectives can help readers make better judgments and develop deeper understanding through consideration of alternative approaches and viewpoints. The capabilities of engaging with multiple perspectives are increasingly important in 21st-century societies in which it has become all too easy for people to sequester themselves in 'echo chambers' that resonate their own viewpoints. The aims of this chapter are to explicate what comprehension of multiple source perspectives involves, how this complex epistemic performance develops, and how it might be promoted in educational settings. We first define source perspectives and describe what representation of source perspectives of informational texts entails. Subsequently, we discuss how perspective comprehension is conceived according to three theoretical approaches: theory of mind research, theories of epistemic development, and the more recent AIR model of epistemic cognition. We show that these theoretical lenses shed light on different facets of this construct. In the last section, we suggest how growth in source perspective comprehension might be fostered by drawing on a new theory of epistemic growth, the Apt-AIR framework.

AB  - The movement of many human interactions to the internet has led to massive volumes of text that contain high-value information about individual choices pertaining to risk and uncertainty. But unlocking these texts’ scientific value is challenging because online texts use slang and obfuscation, particularly so in areas of illicit behavior. Utilizing state-of-the-art techniques, we extract a range of variables from more than 30 million online ads for real-world sex over four years, data significantly larger than that previously developed. We establish prices in a common numeraire and study the correlates of pricing, focusing on risk. We show that there is a 15-19% price premium for services performed at a location of the buyer’s choosing (outcall). Examining how this premium varies across cities and service venues (i.e. incall vs. outcall) we show that most of the variation in prices is likely driven by supply-side decision making. We decompose the price premium into travel costs (75%) and the remainder that is strongly correlated with local violent crime risk. Finally, we show that sex workers demand compensating differentials for the risk that are on par with the very riskiest legal jobs; an hour spent with clients is valued at roughly $151 for incall services compared to an implied travel cost of $36/hour. These results show that offered prices in the online market for real-world sex are driven by the kinds of rational decision-making common to most pricing decisions and demonstrate the value of applying machine reading technologies to complex online text corpora.

AB  - Prior work has examined the role of interest in students’ single text processing and comprehension, but interest has been under-examined within the context of multiple text use. This study examines two forms of interest, individual interest and situational interest, in the context of students’ completion of a multiple text task. Time on texts and the number of texts students accessed were examined in association with both forms of interest and as mediators of the relation between situational interest and task performance. Situational interest, but not individual interest, was found to be associated with time devoted to text use, a measure of persistence or engagement during task completion. Prior knowledge, situational interest, number of texts used, and time on texts were found to predict performance on a multiple text task. Additionally, qualitative data determined how students explained interest as arising during multiple text task completion. Directions for future research and implications for instruction are introduced. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Although much is known about beginning readers using behavioural measures, real‐time processes are still less clear. The present study examined eye movements (skipping rate, gaze, look back and second‐pass duration) as a function of text‐related (difficulty and word class) and student‐related characteristics (word decoding, reading comprehension, short term and working memory). Twenty‐four third and 20 fifth graders read a relatively easy (below grade level) and more difficult text (at grade level). The results showed that skipping rate mainly relied on text characteristics and a three‐way interaction of grade, text difficulty and word class. Gaze durations depended mostly on student characteristics. Results on look backs showed more and longer look backs in difficult texts. Finally, second‐pass duration mostly relied on grade level. To conclude, this study shows that both student and text characteristics should be taken into account when studying online text reading development.

AB  - Three experiments investigated the role of source information (i.e., who said what) in readers’ comprehension of short informational texts. Based on the Discrepancy-Induced Source Comprehension assumption (Braasch, Rouet, Vibert, & Britt, 2012), we hypothesized that readers would be more likely to make use of source information when summarizing stories that included discrepant statements. Readers would also memorize source information more accurately. Experiments 1 and 2 found that American and French college students were more likely to refer to source information when they summarized news reports containing discrepant assertions. A detailed content analysis of the summaries also indicated that students use hedging and several other tactics to resolve contradictions. Experiment 3 replicated Braasch et al.’s finding that sources of discrepant stories were more likely to be recalled than sources of consistent stories. Experiment 3 also extended these findings using longer texts and a different reading task. Altogether the data support the Documents Model framework of multiple source comprehension.

AB  - Learning often involves integration of information from multiple texts. The aim of the current study was to determine whether relevant information from previously read texts is spontaneously activated during reading, allowing for integration between texts (experiment 1 and 2), and whether this process is related to the representation of the texts (experiment 2). In both experiments, texts with inconsistent target sentences were preceded by texts that either did or did not contain explanations that resolved the inconsistencies. In experiment 1, the reading times of the target sentences introducing inconsistencies were faster if the preceding text contained an explanation for the inconsistency than if it did not. This result demonstrates that relevant information from a prior text is spontaneously activated when the target sentence is read. In experiment 2 free recall was used to gain insight into the representation after reading. The reading time results for experiment 2 replicated the reading time results for experiment 1. However, the effects on reading times did not translate to measurable differences in text representations after reading. This research extends our knowledge about the processes involved in multiple text comprehension: Prior text information is spontaneously activated during reading, thereby enabling integration between different texts.

AB  - This chapter focuses on readers’ processing of discrepant information that might be encountered within a single text, between multiple texts, or when content conflicts with the reader’s prior knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes. Based on theoretical models of single and multiple text comprehension, we describe the cognitive processes in which readers engage when they experience cognitive conflict, and when they engage in strategies that serve to re-establish cognitive equilibrium. We focus specifically on the role that sourcing strategies play at different stages of processing, including in attributing the origin of cognitive conflict, in explaining why a discrepancy has occurred, in resolving coherence breaks by evaluating each source’s credibility, and in mentally representing conflicting perspectives. Based on our conceptual and empirical analysis, we discuss implications for adapting current theoretical models to consider readers’ attention to, and evaluation and representation of source perspectives, and we consider how the mechanisms described could be tested empirically.

AB  - The study investigates the cognitive load of students working on tasks that require the comprehension of multiple documents (Multiple Document Comprehension, MDC). In a sample of 310 students, perceived task difficulty (PD) and mental effort (ME) were examined in terms of task characteristics, individual characteristics, and students' processing behavior. Moreover, it was investigated if PD and ME can still contribute to MDC while controlling for these variables. The perceived difficulty of the task was shown to be related to the number of documents, text length, study level, and sourcing. Mental effort was predicted by text length, study level, and processing time. When including these variables as covariates, cognitive load was incrementally predictive of MDC. The results are discussed in terms of how working memory resources can shape the process of comprehending multiple documents. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

Es wurde geprüft, inwiefern die wahrgenommene Aufgabenschwierigkeit und die mentale Anstrengung von 310 Studierenden durch aufgabenspezifische Eigenschaften, individuelle Merkmale und ihr Bearbeitungsverhalten bestimmt werden und darüber hinaus MDC erklären. Für die Aufgabenschwierigkeit wurde gezeigt, dass sie mit der Dokumentenanzahl, der Textlänge, dem Studienniveau sowie der Berücksichtigung von Quellen in Zusammenhang steht. Die mentale Anstrengung wurde durch die Textlänge, das Studienniveau und Bearbeitungszeiten vorhergesagt. Unter Einschluss dieser Variablen als Kovariaten war das Belastungserleben inkrementell prädiktiv für MDC. Die Ergebnisse werden dahingehend diskutiert, wie Arbeitsgedächtnisressourcen den Prozess des Verstehens multipler Dokumente gestalten können.

AB  - This study sought to investigate reading perceptions, computer use perceptions, and online reading comprehension strategy use of 26 students who are deaf/hard of hearing in grades 4 through 8 attending public school districts in a tri-state area of the U.S. Students completed an online questionnaire and descriptive analysis indicated that students liked to read information online and that they felt this was an easy task. Results further revealed moderate use of comprehension strategies. The highest reported usage of comprehension strategies with online text were Problem Solving strategies and the lowest reported usage were Support strategies. Relationships were found between strategies reported to be used and several demographic variables, participants’ perceptions of themselves as a reader, and perceptions of the task of reading online text.

AB  - This study examines the attitude change process based on the heuristic-systematic model (HSM) in persuasion among two individuals holding different opinions, as the simplest situation of multiple directions of persuasion by different sources. Participants with restricted or unrestricted cognitive resources were asked their attitudes after reading two different persuasive messages: one was a persuasion from in-group member with weak arguments and the other was from out-group member with strong arguments. Cognitive resources were manipulated with a dual task (Study 1) and time constraints (Study 2) to allow either heuristic or systematic processes to predominate. Both studies showed participants were more likely to form their attitudes in response to the persuasion from in-group member, which had positive heuristic cues, with weak arguments under a restricted condition than under an unrestricted condition. This provides evidence that the HSM can explain the attitude change process under multiple-source-and-direction persuasion. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The present study aims to investigate the effects of writing tasks and prompts on knowledge integration across domains. One hundred pre-service teachers were asked to read and develop a global understanding of textbook excerpts from the core domains of their professional knowledge: content knowledge (CK), pedagogical knowledge (PK), and pedagogical content knowledge (PCK). In an experimental 2 × 2 design, we varied two means to support knowledge integration, namely, essay writing tasks (unspecific vs. argument) and preactional integration prompts in the form of focus questions (with vs. without). In addition to the essays, a pre-post-knowledge test and an intertextual inference verification task served as dependent variables. Students’ motivation was assessed as a covariate. In all experimental conditions, students showed significant knowledge gains within the three domains. A category-driven content analysis of students’ essays indicated main effects of both writing tasks and prompts. That is, the argument task and the prompts independently promoted knowledge integration across domains. For the intertextual inference verification task, the positive influence of prompts was restricted to students in the unspecific writing task condition and in consideration of a compensatory effect of motivation. Taken together, the study expands evidence for the efficacy of argument tasks and preactional prompts on promoting knowledge integration across pre-service teachers’ CK, PK, and PCK. The findings are discussed with regard to multiple-document comprehension and pre-service teacher education. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Multiple-text comprehension refers to the psychological resources and processes involved in readers' use of two or more texts in order to achieve their purposes. This chapter seeks to provide an overview of how the domain has developed, the main conceptual underpinning of current theories, and what is known regarding the role of text, task, and reader dimensions on the comprehension of multiple texts. It starts with a simple example, and reviews the development of the field, and, examines some empirical evidence regarding factors that affect multiple-text comprehension. The chapter examines the conditions that influence readers' comprehension of multiple texts, considered as an integrated representation of the texts' sources and contents, with at least some selective tagging of content information onto the respective source and some linking across sources through rhetorical relationships such as 'confirms', 'supports', or 'contradicts'. It reviews a range of text factors that promote readers' encoding and integration of source information; then it considers variations in multiple-text comprehension as a function of the task contexts; finally, it reviews some key dimensions of individual differences. The chapter examines some instructional conditions that promote students' ability to comprehend multiple texts. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Project READI defines reading for understanding as the capacity to engage in evidence-based argumentation from multiple text sources of information, situated within a discipline. This definition reflects what is thought of as central competencies needed for success in 21st century society. Yet the evidence indicates that students are graduating from high school without these skills. Project READI is developing interventions whose overarching goal is student attainment of reading for understanding. The authors of this study are simultaneously engaged in design-based research to develop the intervention and basic studies of the cognitive, social, and instructional processes and practices involved in reading for understanding, and are working in three disciplines--literature, history, and science--and across grades 6 to 12. The development of the intervention is based on a theory of change that posits that students' acquisition of knowledge, skills, and dispositions necessary for reading for understanding depends on teachers creating appropriate opportunities to learn. To create these opportunities to learn, teachers need to understand the what, why, and how of instruction that supports reading for understanding, including tasks, text sets, instructional practices, and assessments. The Project READI intervention therefore includes: (1) the development of exemplar instruction in the form of Evidence-Based Argumentation Instructional Modules (E-BAIMs) that can be used in classrooms; and (2) teacher professional development focused on deep analysis of the E-BAIMs and implementations of them, thereby providing teachers with opportunities to develop the expertise needed to implement and adapt modules. This report discusses lessons learned through design-based research regarding important features of the design and implementation of components of the E-BAIMs. The overarching research question is whether the intended outcomes of particular aspects of the design, as well as of the module overall, were achieved. E-BAIMs implementations have been conducted in classrooms in urban and exurban public or publicly-supported charter schools serving children from diverse backgrounds. Design-based research methodology was employed in studying each implementation, with each classroom constituting a case. Qualitative analyses of field notes, interviews, and analytic memos along with qualitative and quantitative analyses of the pre/post assessments and student artifacts over the course of the module were used to inform the fundamental research questions. Analyses indicated increases in noticing symbols and stating claims, as well as some increase in citing information from the texts, but a lack of reasoning that connected the information from the text to the claims. There was little evidence of comparison or contrast across stories. The results of this design-based research indicate several areas that researchers are pursuing in the development of the modules. Tables are appended.

AB  - Research on multiple text comprehension reveals key principles and elements of comprehension: readers’ mental representation, cognitive text processing, and strategy use while reading multiple texts (Goldman, 2004; Rouet, 2006). However, many studies of multiple text comprehension fail to investigate the influence of reader bias. Grounded in both the literature on reading strategies and the social psychology literature on bias (e.g., Edwards & Smith, 1996), this study investigated how readers’ topic beliefs influence comprehension strategies in relation to bias. The participants for this study were 15 undergraduate students, chosen as they represented three distinct topic beliefs related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. There were 5 pro-Israel, 5, pro-Palestine, and 5 neutral participants. While thinking-aloud, participants read two maps and five texts about Israeli settlements in the West Bank, and the ongoing Palestinian-Israeli conflict. The texts and maps were presented in the iMTC (internet-embedded Multiple-Text Comprehension measurement tool) environment (Kim & Cho, 2011). In addition, measures of participants’ prior knowledge and topic beliefs were gathered, while their reading times and Internet searches were recorded by the iMTC. Participants’ verbal reports were coded based on existing coding schemes for reading strategies (Goldman et al., 2012; Pressley & Afflerbach, 1995). Five families of strategy were determined: Considering text content, Acceptance and resistance, Monitoring, Evaluation, and Information need and search. The study has three major findings. First, initial belief differences between groups of different beliefs increased after reading, meaning that participants showed biased assimilation processing during reading. Second, the participants’ biased processing was not detected in the three types of reading measures: reading times, reading orders, and Internet searches. Finally, the study found that participants with different topic beliefs showed different strategic patterns in relation to bias. In particular, acceptance and resistance distinguished the three participant groups’ strategic processing. Participants accepted belief-consistent text information and resisted belief-inconsistent text information. In addition, three cases of participants’ biased strategy use were qualitatively analyzed. The analyses demonstrated that participants’ topic beliefs played a role in creating an interpretive framework that evaluated, accepted, or resisted information during reading. The findings, limitations, implications for future research and instructional practices are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study investigated note‐taking during multiple‐text reading across two different task conditions in relation to comprehension performance and self‐reports of strategy use. Forty‐four undergraduates read multiple texts about climate change to write an argument or a summary. Analysis of students’ spontaneous note‐taking during reading showed that intertextual elaboration strategies, as indicated by the notes, were related to deeper‐level, integrated comprehension for students reading to construct an argument, whereas no such relationship was observed for students reading to summarise information. Relations between note‐taking and self‐reporting of strategies suggested a heightened awareness of strategy use among students reading to construct an argument, with this, possibly, explaining why their note‐taking strategies accounted for variance in their comprehension performance. Discussion focuses on the unique contributions of the current work to multiple‐text strategy research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This qualitative case study investigated 4 Korean elementary level English language learners' (ELLs) cultural identities when they read online texts at home and school. The participants were fourth- or fifth-grade students. The data consisted of observations, interviews, field notes, reflective journals, and the ELLs' verbal reports at home and school between the spring and the fall of 2010. The author's purpose was to identify the influences of reading online texts at home and school in Korean elementary level ELLs' cultural identities. Findings revealed that the online text readings helped the ELLs form, maintain, and shift their cultural identities. The author discusses Korean ELLs' languages, cultures, and technologies in the contexts of electronic literacies and suggests educational implications to facilitate their reading online texts.

AB  - [Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 28(2) of Computer Assisted Language Learning (see record [rid]2015-05827-006[/rid]). In the original article, in Table 1 (page 48), the value of F for SGs Minf, is given as 17827.1; the correct value is 178.2.] Previous studies have evaluated reading comprehension as the general understanding of reading texts. However, this broad and generic assessment of reading comprehension overlooks the specific aspects and processes that students need to develop. This study adopted Kintsch's Construction–Integration model to tap into reading comprehension at different levels and investigated how English as a foreign language (EFL) students benefit from online annotations to scaffold reading comprehension. Fifty EFL students participated in this study and the data collected included (1) the pre- and post-test assessments in reading comprehension levels, (2) the students’ online annotations on reading texts, and (3) the discussion transcripts from an online discussion forum. The results from the first two data sources (1 and 2) were the data-sets used to investigate the influence of the annotation types on reading comprehension levels. The third data source was the data-set used to probe into the process of how students benefited from annotation types to reach different levels of reading comprehension. Four types of online annotations were frequently used by the students while reading online, including (1) marking vocabulary, (2) adding Chinese explanatory notes to unknown vocabulary, (3) marking text information, and (4) adding summary notes to each paragraph. Different frequencies of using the four types of online annotations resulted in three different comprehension levels: surface-based, text-based, and situation-based levels. Marking vocabulary and adding Chinese explanatory notes helped scaffold the students' learning to achieve surface comprehension levels to facilitate recognition and meaning of unknown vocabulary. Marking text information and in particular, the adding of summary notes to each paragraph were the core annotations that helped students comprehend the online text in text-based and situation-based levels. EFL teachers can guide students to use online annotations to different extents in order to deepen their reading comprehension. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Given the importance associated with multiple-document literacy in the present-day knowledge societies and the dearth of research in English Language Teaching in general and English for Specific/Academic Purposes (ESAP) contexts in particular on multiple-document comprehension and the significance of reader beliefs in this type of comprehension, the present study was carried out with the aim of investigating the relationship between ESAP students’ personal epistemological beliefs and their inferential intratextual and intertextual understanding of multiple texts. To this aim, 64 first-semester midwifery students were selected as the participants of the study. They were required to read four passages on multi-fetal pregnancy which discussed different aspects of this phenomenon. Having filled out the Epistemological Beliefs Inventory, they were tested on the inferential intratextual and intertextual comprehension of the texts. Results of the analyses of the data revealed significant associations between epistemological beliefs and the inferential comprehension of multiple texts. The results also indicated the poorer performance of the participants in intertextual inferential understanding of the texts compared with the intratextual understanding of them. The study concludes with tentative implication of the findings for ESAP reading courses. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Selecting and incorporating multiple text and non-text sources is an academic task that has been identified as both commonplace and challenging for undergraduate students. Although the term digital natives is frequently used to describe students of this generation, the degree to which undergraduate students prefer or effectively use digital as compared to print sources has been relatively unaddressed. Additionally, although individual differences such as knowledge have been identified as important for multiple source use and comprehension, the role of motivational variables has been under-examined and has focused on source use within a single medium (i.e., digital or print). This study investigated the role of two motivational variables, interest and curiosity. It examined the degree to which the confluence of these motivational variables in conjunction with knowledge predicted source selection, source use, and task performance when students were provided with multiple print and digital sources. Undergraduate students wore a head-mounted videocamera as they developed a PowerPoint presentation on Alzheimer's disease based on 16 available resources (8 print and 8 digital). Follow-up interviews were conducted to determine the degree to which interest and curiosity influenced students' selection and use of sources. Measures of topic knowledge, topic interest, and epistemic trait curiosity were assessed a priori. A coding scheme for capturing use of print and digital sources was developed for the purpose of this study. Differences across source medium and source type (e.g., textbook, image) were evident. Although students exhibited preferences for selecting several types of sources in a digital format, they spent twice as long using print sources, incorporated more print sources into their presentations, and developed more inferences based on print sources. Students with more knowledge, interest, and curiosity spent more time using print sources but less time using digital sources. Further, students' presentations revealed a tendency to replicate material from sources rather than to draw inferences, make conclusions, or integrate material across sources. Findings suggest the tendency for undergraduate students to focus their processes on the management of information rather source integration particularly when using digital compared to print sources.

AB  - In this article, we examine the cognitive processes that are involved when readers comprehend conflicting information in multiple texts. Starting from the notion of routine validation during comprehension, we argue that readers' prior beliefs may lead to a biased processing of conflicting information and a one-sided mental model of controversial issues (text-belief consistency effect). An important distinction is that such biases occur routinely as a by-product of basic comprehension processes. However, readers can actively engage in strategies that work against the biasing effects of prior beliefs when they possess the relevant cognitive resources and are motivated to activate them. A review of published studies that examined belief effects in multiple text comprehension supports the two-step model of validation. We discuss implications of this model for multiple text comprehension and educational practice and delineate directions for future research.

AB  - We introduce a special issue featuring four theoretical models of multiple text comprehension. We present a central framework for conceptualizing the four models in this special issue. Specifically, we chart the models according to how they consider learner, texts, task, and context factors in explaining multiple text comprehension. In addition, the models are contrasted along three dimensions capturing different orientations toward multiple text comprehension. Models in the special issue are described as more behaviorally or cognitively focused, as conceptualizing multiple text comprehension as an internally driven or an externally triggered process, and as directly responsive to or indirectly influenced by task. The importance and relevance of this special issue for research on multiple text comprehension are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In this chapter we begin with a description of the situated nature of inaccuracy, considering it in relation to models of text comprehension and strategic reading. We propose that the cooperative principle is helpful in accounting for the context-dependent nature of inaccuracy and how the dynamics of reader, text, goal, and situation contribute to the determination that information is inaccurate. We provide three scenarios involving multiple text and Internet reading to illustrate the situated nature of inaccuracy. Then, we synthesize existing research to describe the strategies used by successful readers for determining when text is inaccurate during Internet readings of multiple texts. Next, we use think-aloud protocol data to examine how accomplished high school students, reading in Internet environments, determine accuracy in texts on controversial topics. We conclude with consideration of the importance of the concept of inaccurate information for both reading comprehension theory and reading instruction practice. What is inaccurate information in text? In this chapter, we equate accuracy with truth—an author who strives for accuracy has a goal of providing the reader with truthful information.

AB  - The effectiveness of instructional designs has been examined in several recent educational studies. Instructional design, both traditional and technology-based, can sometimes overload a learner’s cognitive effort and thus negatively influence learning performance. The same learning material can induce different amounts of memory load as a result of differences in the instructional design used for its presentation. The present study aims to investigate the cognitive load effects of instructional formats (split-attention and integrated formats) and text presentation types (paper-based and online) on students’ second language reading comprehension performance. In a split-attention format, comprehension questions were placed at the end of the reading text, while in an integrated format, comprehension questions were physically integrated into relevant paragraphs of the reading text. The quantitative data was collected through reading comprehension tests from forty pre-service teachers in an English Language Teaching department. The result of this post-test-only experimental design study showed that there was no statistically significant difference across the four groups, Online Reading-Split Attention Format; Online Reading-Integrated Format; Paper-based Reading Split Attention Format; and Paper-based Reading Integrated Format, in terms of students’ second language reading comprehension (L2) reading comprehension scores. On the other hand, the result showed that there was a statistically significant difference in L2 comprehension between participants who read online text and those who read paper-based text.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to provide baseline information regarding the comprehension processes second graders use when reading informational text in print and online form. The study focused on informational text found in print, in closed hypertext Web sites, and during open Internet searches because academic success depends on the quick retrieval of information in both informational print and online text. This collective case study found that second graders used a variety of comprehension strategies in all three reading contexts. Although there were similarities in strategy usage across all three reading contexts, there were important differences between reading print text and text encountered during open Internet searching that relate to realizing and constructing potential texts to read. Based on the study's findings it is recommended that comprehension instruction with informational print and online text begin in the primary grades to improve strategy use and efficiency in locating information in those texts.

AB  - Research on multiple source use concerns how readers handle a number of different, often conflicting or discrepant, information sources to construct a mental representation of content. Students are increasingly being exposed to such complex reading situations, both in and outside of school. The digital world demands multiple source use, and students must be prepared to critically evaluate sources varying widely in genre, design, and trustworthiness. In this special issue of Educational Psychologist, four articles present different models of how readers approach and process multiple information sources. The four contributions, to varying degrees, represent elaborations and extensions of the Multiple Documents Framework (Perfetti, Rouet, & Britt, 1999). This commentary summarizes the four articles and discusses the articles in relation to prior models and to some assumptions apparently underpinning current models of multiple source use.

AB  - People obtain information from a plethora of sources in their daily lives, including newspapers, websites, blogs, text messages, and conversations. Because much of this information is dubious, it is important that individuals be able to determine what information is true and worth remembering, and what can be safely discounted. Unfortunately, research suggests that people often fail to critically evaluate information in a variety of circumstances, though the extent to which individuals critically evaluate information in their everyday lives, and the criteria they use when doing so, remains understudied. Further, educational interventions intended to increase students' reliance on source information have been relatively brief, and have yielded mixed results. This dissertation explored (a) how students evaluate credibility 'in the wild,' and (b) whether practice evaluating source information might foster subsequent critical evaluation and comprehension of texts. Study 1 examined students' evaluations of the credibility of information encountered in their daily experiences, using a diary methodology. Students used many evaluative criteria, but relied most on the consistency of information with their prior knowledge; content that violated prior knowledge was considered non-credible. Implausible content, familiar yet unreliable sources, and persuasive intentions also reduced perceptions of credibility, while expert and authoritative sources enhanced credibility. These patterns varied with episode context, content type, information medium, and interaction partner, empirically demonstrating the importance of contextual dimensions on credibility evaluation. Study 2 assessed the impact of long-term evaluative practice on students' critical evaluations, using the diary task as an intervention. Students who practiced evaluating texts for 30 days became particularly attentive to the consistency of text content with their prior knowledge, relative to controls. This increased attention to content contributed to better integration of content across disparate texts in a multiple document reading task. This work contributes to research on credibility evaluation by articulating a role for prior knowledge in this process, and by illustrating the influence of context on students' critical evaluations of their everyday communicative interactions. In addition, results suggest that long-term interventions requiring students to connect text content with their prior knowledge may usefully affect their evaluation and comprehension of texts.

AB  - This thesis presents the results of research into the process of editing and the decisions faced by editors when approaching early modern texts. By looking at problems faced by editors of Renaissance texts, such as the difficulty of editing and presenting texts that exist in more than one version, for example Shakespeare's King Lear, it has enabled me to gain a better understanding of how these issues can be approached and how technology can assist in this.The thesis outlines the areas of the domain into which research has been undertaken, those where it is currently being investigated, and those which may be explored in the future. A literature review of relevant texts has been included, as well as a review of some of the existing methods of viewing texts electronically. I have focused my practical research on how scholarly readers at Undergraduate level respond to being confronted with an unstable text. The term 'Active Reading' is used in this case to refer to a level of dynamic involvement with the text, where editorial decision-making can affect the meaning of the text.In observing the methods by which they currently examine and edit multiple-texts, I have been able to study readers and find out how they would like to be able to undertake this task using technology. I have utilized the knowledge gathered from this research to begin editing my own section of a Renaissance play using TEI XML, and to design some prototype editions of a Renaissance poem incorporating several interactive methods of engaging with multiple-text editions. I hope that by documenting the process of producing this work, as well as drawing conclusions from my findings from user trials, that this will contribute to new work in the development of electronic texts for literary readers.

AB  - This book explores the comprehension tasks and challenges facing students at different grade levels, with attention to multiple text types and reading purposes. Preeminent researchers offer a range of perspectives―cognitive, neuroscientific, sociocultural, pedagogical, and technological―on key aspects of comprehension. The book reviews effective approaches to assessment, instruction, and intervention. It also addresses issues in teaching specific populations, including struggling readers and English language learners. New to this edition are discussions of: a decades worth of significant research advances reflected in 10 entirely new chapters; new studies and timely topics: the expanding role of technology, changing school populations, the Common Core standards, international research, and more. New chapters are provided on graphic, scientific, and multiple digital texts; and chapters on fluency, professional learning, and literacy coaching. The primary goals of this second edition are to help the reader attain a deeper understanding of how the past has influenced the present in the field of reading comprehension and to take action on providing teachers with critical knowledge on reading comprehension. The book, in its broader integrated perspective, also offers practical benefits to a wider population interested in literacy and the influence of reading comprehension. The book remains the most distinctive, comprehensive volume on the knowledge base that frames the theory and research on reading comprehension to date. The contributions of researchers from all over the world in the areas of comprehension instruction, psychology, educational psychology, neuroscience, and literacy build upon the foundations of the first edition and bridge the past and the present in the field of reading comprehension research and theory. The book can be a resource for teachers, policymakers, and educators that documents the developmental nature of reading comprehension from historical, theoretical, and methodological perspectives.

AB  - Readers increasingly attempt to understand and learn from information sources they find on the Internet. Doing so highlights the crucial role that evaluative processes play in selecting and making sense of the information. In a prior study, Wiley et al. (2009, Experiment 1) asked undergraduates to perform a web-based inquiry task about volcanoes using multiple Internet sources. A major finding established a clear link between learning outcomes, source evaluations, and reading behaviors. The present study used think-aloud protocol methodology to better understand the processing that learners engaged in during this task: 10 better learners were contrasted with 11 poorer learners. Results indicate that better learners engaged in more sense-making, self-explanation, and comprehension-monitoring processes on reliable sites as compared with unreliable sites, and did so by a larger margin than did poorer learners. Better learners also engaged in more goal-directed navigation than poorer learners. Case studies of two better and two poorer learners further illustrate how evaluation processes contributed to navigation decisions. Findings suggest that multiple-source comprehension is a dynamic process that involves interplay among sense-making, monitoring, and evaluation processes, all of which promote strategic reading.

AB  - In this chapter we present research on how different kinds of high- and low level questions influence readers' processing and comprehension of task-relevant text information when reading single or multiple texts. Research has shown that questions can influence how readers allocate their attention to task-relevant information, which can affect text comprehension and learning. However, additional research is still needed to understand how readers interact with the single- and multiple-text contexts when answering questions. We discuss empirical research on question-driven processing and learning when students read single and multiple texts. This research not only indicates that questions differentially affect processing of relevant information and learning from single and multiple texts, but also provides evidence for parallels in strategic processing between the two reading contexts.

AB  - In present-day knowledge societies, competent reading involves the integration of information from multiple sources into a coherent, meaningful representation of a topic, issue, or situation. This article reviews research and theory concerning the comprehension of multiple textual resources, focusing especially on linkages recently established between dimensions of epistemic beliefs and multiple-text comprehension. Moreover, a proposed model incorporates epistemic beliefs into a theoretical framework for explaining multiple-text comprehension, specifying how and why different epistemic belief dimensions may be linked to the comprehension and integration of multiple texts. Also discussed is the need for further research concerning mediational mechanisms, causality, and generalizability. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - As technology develops, the prevalence of conventional book dictionaries has slowly declined due to advancements in computer-mediated aids, such as online type-in dictionaries and program-installed pop-up aids. The goal of this study was to examine how technology 'may' have changed the long-standing pedagogical practice of book dictionary usage by identifying the learning processes associated with various dictionaries and verifying how these processes are related to learning. Cognitive load theory was applied to generate predictions about learning performance and, therefore, to determine the nature of these processes. Information contained in each dictionary was specifically controlled, and thus we focused on the effect of the learning process alone. In the experiment, students first read a simulated online text in one of four conditions: pop-up, type-in, book dictionaries or no aid. They were later tested for reading comprehension and vocabulary learning. Results indicated that all dictionaries enhanced vocabulary learning but not comprehension. Close examination revealed that vocabulary-learning efficiency was significantly higher for the pop-up dictionary than the other two aids. In addition, a complex relationship existed between reading comprehension and vocabulary learning. This study has important implications for future dictionary design and pedagogical advice regarding dictionary usage. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Building on previous studies of multiple text reading in history, this study aimed to contribute to that body of work by focusing on non-traditional multimodal sources. In an age of rapidly increasing access to and use of multimodal sources and a demand for reading and comprehending increasingly complex and specialized texts, it appeared there was a gap in the research that this study could help to address. This study used mixed methods to investigate 1) how students read multiple multimodal sources, 2) how those multimodal sources influenced students' historical reasoning, 3) how students used multimodal sources to respond to a historical inquiry question through an argumentative essay, and 4) how individual learner characteristics like prior knowledge, interest, and reading ability contributed to students' ability to construct an argument after reading multiple multimodal sources. Fifty-one students in two high school history classes participated in the study. Forty-three students completed a three day inquiry task, using a single website to read eight multimodal sources about the Gulf of Tonkin Incident and wrote an essay. Eight students completed think-aloud protocols while reading the same eight multimodal sources and participated in a semi-structured interview immediately following the think-aloud protocol. Data was analyzed for historical thinking processes, the ways multiple sources influenced student thinking, the ways students used multiple sources in their essays, and how prior knowledge, interest, and reading ability contributed to their ability to create a historical argument using multiple multimodal sources. The results of this study suggest that the use of multimodal sources in historical inquiry may benefit less proficient readers. The study also demonstrated that students could reason with complex historical sources. Despite the complexity of thinking revealed by students, it is also evident that multimodal sources cannot just be added to the curriculum. Disciplinary literacy strategies are necessary to help foster critical and integrated reading of complex historical sources. Multimodal sources did not help students to write high quality arguments either. Teacher scaffolding of writing for argument is critical regardless of the text types used for inquiry.

AB  - The current experiments systematically examined semantic content integration as a mechanism for explaining source inattention and forgetting when reading-to-remember multiple texts. For all 3 experiments, degree of semantic overlap was manipulated amongst messages provided by various information sources. In Experiment 1, readers’ source recognition was significantly poorer when the sources presented semantically-congruent compared to semantically-distinct messages. Experiment 2 replicated the findings, despite half of the participants receiving a pre-reading warning. Experiment 3 extended the examination to include longer argument-based texts; readers additionally wrote a comprehensive essay on the topic. The results indicated longer reading times and better recall memory for the claims and evidence statements from semantically-congruent compared to semantically-distinct texts, while still reproducing the poorer source recognition effects of Experiments 1 and 2. We discuss implications for contemporary accounts of multiple text comprehension as well as directions for future research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - A reading perspective refers to the point of view the reader has in mind during reading. For example, a person who is planning a vacation in Helsinki will have a different perspective on a newspaper article describing cities in Northern Europe than a person who is planning a trip to Oslo. Previous research shows that readers rate text segments that are relevant to their perspective as more important than other text segments, they spend longer time reading relevant than irrelevant text information, and they also recall perspective-relevant text information better than other text information. In our recent research program, we have investigated how reading perspectives influence online text processing and memory for text information. We have also examined how reader- (prior knowledge and working memory capacity) and text-related (transparency of perspective-relevance) factors moderate the perspective effects. In this chapter, we will provide a review of our research findings and describe a framework of perspective-driven text comprehension, a theoretical framework that aims to describe how reader- and text-related factors influence perspective-driven reading. Finally, we will discuss the potential practical implications of our research, and raise some questions for future research. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study investigated whether source information attached to texts influences multiple-text comprehension about genetically modified (GM) foods—a controversial science topic Participants in the experiment read two texts from two sources' an expert and/or a layperson. When the two texts presented different attitudes toward GM foods (Experiment 1), expert information facilitated intra-text comprehension. Moreover, expert information was better integrated with other information; when expert information was presented first, later information was less integrated with participants’ understanding, and when expert information was presented last, it was more integrated. When the two texts presented common attitudes (Experiment 2), a similar pattern of effects was observed, but the effects were weaker than those in Experiment 1. Thus, expert source information has the potential to affect the comprehension of scientific information, and careful planning is required for effective risk communication.

AB  - Understanding how people learn from text is a tradition in educational psychology. Until recently, this has been associated with a focus on content acquisition versus understanding. However, increased recognition of the role of literacy in the practice of scientists, in learning science, and in how experience with scientific practices can develop literacy skills has reframed these perspectives. Literacy goals are now part of the Next Generation Science Standards. This chapter engages these trends in the study of the role of text in science learning. It examines questions concerning the intersection of multiple-document comprehension and everyday science problem solving. What skills facilitate problem solving? What characterizes the texts available for problem solving? How can we cultivate these skills? What are the implications for curriculum and instruction?

AB  - The purpose of this study was to test a hypothesized model that specified direct and indirect linkages between the individual difference variables of epistemic beliefs, need for cognition, individual interest, and prior knowledge, the processing variables of effort, deeper-level strategies, and situational interest, and multiple-text comprehension. Using a path analysis approach with a sample of 279 Norwegian upper secondary school students, results indicated that students’ effort and deeper-level strategies predicted their multiple-text comprehension, with the individual difference variables indirectly affecting multiple-text comprehension through their influence on effortful, adaptive multiple-text processing. In addition, students’ prior knowledge about the topic of the texts seemed to affect their multiple-text comprehension directly as well as indirectly. Both theoretical and educational implications of the results are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Reports an error in 'Promoting different reading comprehension levels through online annotations' by Sheng-Shiang Tseng, Hui-Chin Yeh and Shih-hsien Yang (Computer Assisted Language Learning, 2015[Jan], Vol 28[1], 41-57). In the original article, in Table 1 (page 48), the value of F for SGs Minf is given as 17827.1; the correct value is 178.2. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2014-56144-004[/rid]). Previous studies have evaluated reading comprehension as the general understanding of reading texts. However, this broad and generic assessment of reading comprehension overlooks the specific aspects and processes that students need to develop. This study adopted Kintsch's Construction–Integration model to tap into reading comprehension at different levels and investigated how English as a foreign language (EFL) students benefit from online annotations to scaffold reading comprehension. Fifty EFL students participated in this study and the data collected included (1) the pre- and post-test assessments in reading comprehension levels, (2) the students’ online annotations on reading texts, and (3) the discussion transcripts from an online discussion forum. The results from the first two data sources (1 and 2) were the data-sets used to investigate the influence of the annotation types on reading comprehension levels. The third data source was the data-set used to probe into the process of how students benefited from annotation types to reach different levels of reading comprehension. Four types of online annotations were frequently used by the students while reading online, including (1) marking vocabulary, (2) adding Chinese explanatory notes to unknown vocabulary, (3) marking text information, and (4) adding summary notes to each paragraph. Different frequencies of using the four types of online annotations resulted in three different comprehension levels: surface-based, text-based, and situation-based levels. Marking vocabulary and adding Chinese explanatory notes helped scaffold the students' learning to achieve surface comprehension levels to facilitate recognition and meaning of unknown vocabulary. Marking text information and in particular, the adding of summary notes to each paragraph were the core annotations that helped students comprehend the online text in text-based and situation-based levels. EFL teachers can guide students to use online annotations to different extents in order to deepen their reading comprehension. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Students must independently complete academic literacy tasks—including reading analytically to identify problems, resolving problems that arise, and using writing to demonstrate advanced knowledge acquisition—if they are to be successful in courses across their university careers. However, a significant portion of students arrives at the university underprepared to meet these expectations for academic literacy. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of an instructional intervention to help developmental-level freshmen acquire the academic literacy skills that experienced academic readers demonstrate in order to promote independent learning. The four-week instructional intervention focused on two aspects of advanced academic literacy: 1) identifying inconsistencies across multiple texts and 2) flexibly employing evaluative heuristics (sourcing, corroboration, & contextualization) in order to resolve inconsistencies. The study, which took place at a large, urban, public university over the course of five weeks in two intact sections of a developmental-level academic literacy course taught by one instructor, used a pre-experimental one group pretest-posttest design. Participants (N = 31) were administered the Multiple Text Tasks as a pretest and a posttest in order to measure three dependent variables: 1) the number of inconsistencies identified, 2) the number of evaluative heuristics used in writing, and 3) the number of evaluative heuristics used in reading. More participants were categorized as High Use in their ability to recognize inconsistencies across multiple texts postintervention. This result was statistically significant. Although participants did increase their use of evaluative heuristics in writing and in reading postintervention, these results did not reach statistical significance. One unique finding was that developmental-level freshmen in this study used the contextualization heuristic at higher rates than in previous studies. The results suggest that the instructional intervention contributed to an increase in the number of inconsistencies identified. The increase in evaluative heuristic use suggests that the intervention may have contributed to increased use of evaluative heuristics. However, the failure to reach statistical significance suggests that the intervention was not of adequate intensity or duration. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - People have been reading on computer screens for several decades now, predating popularization of personal computers and widespread use of the internet. But it was the rise of eReaders and tablets that caused digital reading to explode. In 2007, Amazon introduced its first Kindle. Three years later, Apple debuted the iPad. Meanwhile, as mobile phone technology improved and smartphones proliferated, the phone became another vital reading platform. In Words Onscreen, Naomi Baron, an expert on language and technology, explores how technology is reshaping our understanding of what it means to read. Digital reading is increasingly popular. Reading onscreen has many virtues, including convenience, potential cost-savings, and the opportunity to bring free access to books and other written materials to people around the world. Yet, Baron argues, the virtues of eReading are matched with drawbacks. Users are easily distracted by other temptations on their devices, multitasking is rampant, and screens coax us to skim rather than read in-depth. What is more, if the way we read is changing, so is the way we write. In response to changing reading habits, many authors and publishers are producing shorter works and ones that don't require reflection or close reading. In her tour through the new world of eReading, Baron weighs the value of reading physical print versus online text, including the question of what long-standing benefits of reading might be lost if we go overwhelmingly digital. She also probes how the internet is shifting reading from being a solitary experience to a social one, and the reasons why eReading has taken off in some countries, especially the United States and UK, but not others, like France and Japan. Going beyond the hype on both sides of the discussion, Baron draws upon her own cross-cultural studies to offer a clear-eyed and balanced analysis of the ways technology is affecting the ways we read today—and what the future might bring.

AB  - Success in today's knowledge society requires the use of multiple sources of information to accomplish personal and professional goals. However, little is known about how young adolescents select, analyze, and synthesize multiple sources to address inquiry tasks. Using evidence-centered design we have constructed and tested web-based assessment activities for the selection of sources and for the analysis and synthesis of information across text sets. The activities are contextualized in science or history inquiry topics. The assessment activities are designed to provide formative information about student performance that can be used to plan instruction. The design process and the analyses of student performance on these activities are highlighting the unique challenges and opportunities of multiple source comprehension situations. Two contexts serve to frame the contents of this chapter and its combined focus on technology, literacy, and assessment. The first context is very broad and considers the ways in which educators and researchers should be thinking about technology and its intersection with the processes of teaching, learning, and assessment in K-16+ education. To frame these issues we briefly discuss aspects of the vision put forth earlier this year in the National Educational Technology Plan (NETP). The second context is more specific and focuses on a particular set of 21st century competencies that fall under the general heading of digital literacy. The specific focus is on understanding and assessing the knowledge and skills associated with the process of multiple source comprehension. We consider each of these framing contexts in turn as a way to situate the significance of the R&D work described in the remainder of this chapter.

AB  - Creative problem solving, collaboration, and technology fluency are core skills requisite of any nation's workforce that strives to be competitive in the 21st Century. Teaching these types of skills is an economic imperative, and assessment is a fundamental component of any pedagogical program. Yet, measurement of these skills is complex due to the interacting factors associated with higher order thinking and multifaceted communication. Advances in assessment theory, educational psychology, and technology create an opportunity to innovate new methods of measuring students' 21st Century Skills with validity, reliability, and scalability. In this book, leading scholars from multiple disciplines present their latest research on how to best measure complex knowledge, skills, and abilities using technology-based assessments. All authors discuss theoretical and practical implications from their research and outline their visions for the future of technology-based assessments.

AB  - Research shows that students struggle with tasks involving sourcing and argumentation. Prior research investigating students' evaluation of information from the internet has used materials that may have confounded source reliability and content accuracy. In the current study, source and content were un-confounded to examine whether students' goals for relevance included the reliability of sources and addressing other side information. The design of the materials for this study allowed for the direct tracking of the use of information presented by the sources. Experiment 1 examined how activating knowledge prior to the task influences specific decision points. Participants were then given a set of documents and asked to select a sub-set to read with intent of writing an essay about mankind's responsibility in global warming. Half of the sources were reliable (i.e., knowledgeable, experts with credentials) and half were unreliable on these dimensions. Half of the documents supported the influence of mankind and half supported nature. None of the content, itself, was clearly false or a misconception. After selection, participants then read and took notes from only the smaller set of documents. When finished reading, participants wrote their argumentative essay. The results show that half of the documents selected had unreliable sources and participants used information from unreliable documents in their notes and essays. Participants selected more myside documents vs. other side and this bias was even more exaggerated in the notes and essay. Finally, simply hinting at creating appropriate goals was ineffective. Experiment 2 assessed the extent to which an instructional intervention could improve argument performance in terms of argument completeness and consideration of source reliability. These results show that undergraduates fail to use source information to filter documents at time of selection and when deciding to use information in their essays. This experiment also replicates the myside bias effect. This study extends prior research by tracking the use of information from multiple reliable and unreliable source documents along multiple decision points during a multiple document argumentation task. Furthermore, this study goes beyond the current literature by un-confounding source and content information. These findings point to potential supports for improving argumentation and information evaluation skills. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The purpose of the study was to understand student interaction and learning supported by a collaboratively social annotation tool—Diigo. The researcher examined through a case study how students participated and interacted when learning an online text with the social annotation tool—Diigo, and how they perceived their experience. The findings suggested that students participated actively in the collaborative learning activity and were engaged in a variety of behaviors including self-reflection, elaboration, internalization, and showing support. Although students generally had a moderately positive attitude toward using the social annotation tool for collaborative learning, a few problems were identified. In particular, students found it distracting to navigate through a large amount of annotation while reading the text. The study has implications for future research on using or developing social annotation tools for educational purposes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

In the original article, there was an error in the sentence on page 255. The corrections are present in the erratum.] New media, new knowledge practices, and concepts point to the need for greater understanding of cognitive processes underlying knowledge acquisition and generation in open informational worlds. The authors of the articles in this special issue address cognitive and instructional challenges surrounding multiple document comprehension—a prerequisite of digital literacy and knowledge work in the information age. In this article, we raise issues of conceptual clarity regarding constructs such as source and document, and discuss work in disciplinary literacy and knowledge-building communities to clarify uses of information resources to support knowledge creation. The discussion aims to (a) provide insights into the cognitive and social practices needed for students to manage, understand, apply, and create knowledge and (b) suggest research directions to advance these goals.

AB  - Research has shown that students who find required reading too difficult might avoid reading due to a lack of self-efficacy (Chapman & Tunmer, 1995; Guthrie, Coddington, & Wigfield, 2009; McRae & Guthrie, 2009; Strommen & Mates, 2004). Research has indicated that self-efficacy is positively related to motivation (Becca, 2001; Cole, 2002; Guthrie, 2000; Lau, 2009). Therefore, when students believe they can complete required readings with little difficulty or in a reasonable amount of time, they become more motivated to read. This study sought to establish a link between reading online with a hyperlinked dictionary and increased motivation to read. While not able to establish a significant increase in efficacy overall after the treatment of hyperlinking online text to an online dictionary, pockets of significant increases in efficacy in subscales and a positive attitude toward the use of a hyperlinked dictionary support further research and development of online reading materials that use a hyperlinked dictionary.

AB  - In the chapter, the author first describes a bit of her personal history, especially as it intersected with and was influenced by Isabel Beck and her work. In the process, the author shares her theoretical perspectives on comprehension and the evolution of those in response to empirical data and developments in contemporary theories of learning. The centerpiece of the chapter is a description of the evidence-centered design process the author and her colleagues are using to develop the assessment of multiple-source comprehension to conduct inquiry in history. These researchers are collecting information from middle school students about how they used specific sources and how they evaluated the importance and utility of those sources in completing an inquiry-based project. The final sections of the chapter discuss instructional implications and future direction. The authors' assessment work makes direct connections to classroom instructional practices, because the audiences for the assessment are teachers and students in middle school classrooms. Simultaneously, the design process contributes to the development of a model of multiple source comprehension and raises questions for future research efforts.

AB  - We introduce the MD-TRACE model (for Multiple-Document Task-based Relevance Assessment and Content Extraction), a descriptive model of the resources and the processes brought to bear in document-based activities. The MD-TRACE model considers the external resources that take part in functional reading activities (beyond text passages), as well as the cognitive resources that these activities call upon. The MD-TRACE model defines live core processes: the construction of a task model; the assessment of one's information needs; the selection, processing and integration of document information; the construction of a task product; and the assessment of product quality. These processes are helpful in identifying the many ways in which relevance processes take place during functional reading. We discuss several research questions that are derived from the revised model. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Reports an error in 'Managing, understanding, applying, and creating knowledge in the information age: Next-generation challenges and opportunities' by Susan R. Goldman and Marlene Scardamalia (Cognition and Instruction, 2013[Apr], Vol 31[2], 255-269). In the original article, there was an error in the sentence on page 255. The corrections are present in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2013-13570-008[/rid]). New media, new knowledge practices, and concepts point to the need for greater understanding of cognitive processes underlying knowledge acquisition and generation in open informational worlds. The authors of the articles in this special issue address cognitive and instructional challenges surrounding multiple document comprehension—a prerequisite of digital literacy and knowledge work in the information age. In this article, we raise issues of conceptual clarity regarding constructs such as source and document, and discuss work in disciplinary literacy and knowledge-building communities to clarify uses of information resources to support knowledge creation. The discussion aims to (a) provide insights into the cognitive and social practices needed for students to manage, understand, apply, and create knowledge and (b) suggest research directions to advance these goals.
