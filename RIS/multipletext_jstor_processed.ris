TI  - Functional Language Instruction and the Writing Growth of English Language Learners in the Middle Years
AU  - HUMPHREY, SALLY
AU  - MACNAUGHT, LUCY
AB  - [In this article the authors report on the use of a scaffolding pedagogy (Gibbons, 2009), informed by systemic functional linguistics, to support the writing of English language learners in middle years curriculum learning. They focus on the work of one teacher and her English class across the first 18 months of a longitudinal design-based literacy research project, Embedding Literacies in the Key Learning Areas (ELK). This 3-year project was conducted in an Australian urban secondary school with 97.5% of students from language backgrounds other than English. A core aspect of the pedagogy implemented through the ELK project is the use of a shared metalanguage to make visible the patterns of language valued for discipline learning. Analysis of instructional materials, classroom discourse, and data on students' achievement on standardized external and formative internal assessments of writing over 18 months indicates that growth in writing is related to pedagogical practices that include consistent use of a functional metalanguage in classroom modeling of exemplar texts and in feedback on students' writing.]

TI  - The stories of our national past: History and heritage in a Jewish high school
AU  - Zakai, Sivan
AB  - This paper explores the relationship between the teaching of history (the academic study of the past) and the teaching of heritage (meaningful stories tying people to a collective past). The research was conducted in a Jewish high school whose explicit mission involves teaching history through a US history course and heritage through an Israeli history course. Yet in reality, both classes, in different ways and to different effects, were engaged in a shared quest to help students understand the past and find meaning in its stories. This paper shows that history and heritage &#x2014; often viewed by scholars as distinct enterprises &#x2014; are neither clearly delineated nor mutually exclusive within the context of high school history education. By exploring two different attempts to navigate the murky waters of history and heritage, this paper highlights the tensions that arise when teachers aim to help students find personal and collective meaning, as well as intellectual stimulation, in their studies of the past.

AU  - Chang, Yueh-ching

AB  - [While research in L2 language and literacy in academic contexts has shed light on learning language per se (e.g., students' development of syntactic complexity), classroom situations, in which ESL students engage in English and make it meaningful to them, have received far less attention. With a sociocultural perspective, this qualitative case study examined the discursive practices of a face-to-face community college ESL classroom and of its online discussion forums. We found that the discourse in the face-to-face classroom tended to prioritize shaping students' academic knowledge and identity, pushing aside knowledge and identities that were peer- or life-world based. In contrast, the online forums afforded discourses through which students displayed peer-based, life-world, and academic knowledge and identities, while negotiating responses to academic assignments. The study suggests that classroom-based online forums can provide a space for the legitimate display of students' nonacademic discourses in the service of academic work.]

AB  - eTextbooks are both texts and tools. They provide opportunities for textbook companies to expand their services. Some large textbook companies are offering extensive educational technology products and services along with texts. These etexts, integrated into the Learning Management System (LMS), give instructors opportunities to use integrated assessments, data collection tools with in-depth usage statistics, and social networking features that allow instructors and students to interact within the publisher's material. News stories often discuss problems with blended and online learning and contentious relationships between faculty and vendors; etexts are part of the discussion. This paper describes findings from narrative interviews with instructors who have used etexts, focusing on affordability, access, privacy, and outsourcing. The goal is to inform instructors and administrators of some pros and cons of etexts.

AU  - Folkes, Valerie S.
AU  - Matta, Shashi
AB  - [We investigated when consumers' judgments about a product reflect information about its product source (the person who creates the product). Three experiments manipulated congruence between the source's gender and the gender-typing of the source's product. When congruent with expectations (a male conductor played male-typed music), pre-trial source information had the same effect on post-trial product judgments as when source information was absent. Incongruence (a female conductor played male-typed music) distorted product attribute judgments when the source's competence was questioned. Her music was judged to be more delicate, less powerful and worse quality than his. This process of product experience being assimilated into incompetence stereotypes required minimal cognitive resources. When the incongruent source was undoubtedly competent, the amount of experiential evidence about an attribute influenced distortion. Consumers judged powerful music as powerful regardless of conductor gender, but, lacking much evidence about its delicacy, judged hers as more delicate than his. The selective effect of source gender information reflects consumers' cognitively effortful hypothesis testing of beliefs that gender expresses itself in a person's output against experiential evidence.]

AB  - [Purpose: Given the increased usage of mentoring programs in multi-cultural settings, including the Chinese workplace, the present study examined Chinese employees' understanding of mentoring relationships and whether mentoring played a role in their occupational stress process. Methodology: Using open-ended questions, Phase 1 of the study investigated the understanding of mentoring relationships from 39 academic experts in relevant fields and 22 practitioners with management experiences. Using a survey approach, Phase 2 examined mentoring within a stressor-strain framework among a sample of employees in China, qualitatively (N = 207) and quantitatively (N= 1,281). Findings: Results from this study indicate that Chinese employees understood mentoring relationships in a way similar to Western employees. Although mentored Chinese employees reported a level of psychological strains similarto those not mentored, they demonstrated stronger positive relations between Stressors (supervisory relationship concerns, career advancement concerns, and work-family conflict) and strains (depression and emotional exhaustion) than their unmentored counterparts. Implications: These findings supported the transferability of the mentoring concept and process from Western cultures to China, a Confucian culture. More importantly, the role of mentoring in the occupational stress process was shown to be complex and intriguing. Originality/Value: This research not only advances our understanding of mentoring outside Western cultures, but also identifies the need for future investigation of the complex role of mentoring relationships in employee and organizational stress management.]

AB  - [Collaborative learning has much to offer but not all learners participate fully and peer groups can be exclusive. The article examines how belonging or 'congruence' in learning groups is related to identities of gender, age, ethnicity and socio-economic status. A study of student experiences of collaborative learning on three different blended learning courses illustrated how learners negotiate identity congruence with peer groups to belong and engage. An analytical framework that distinguishes social, operational and knowledge-related identity congruence has emerged. Contrary to received wisdom, the social aspect appears least important for learner engagement while knowledge-related identity congruence is fundamental. Some of the consequences of identity incongruence, particularly concerning gender and maturity, are discussed and the article points towards the pedagogies which might enable identities of group members to shift so that collaborative learning can flourish.]

AU  - Song, Yi
AU  - Sparks, Jesse R.
AB  - [In this paper, we describe an effort to develop and evaluate an innovative formative assessment to gather evidence about middle school students' argumentation skills. Specifically, this game-enhanced scenario-based assessment (Seaball—Semester at Sea) includes a series of argumentative reasoning activities in the context of an extended scenario wherein students debate the issue of whether junk food should be sold to students. These activities were designed around argumentation learning progressions (i.e., hypotheses about the qualitative shifts that occur as students achieve higher levels of sophistication in argumentation) which serve as a framework to determine the targeted skills, levels and activity sequences. Performance feedback is also provided in the assessment. We conducted a pilot study, aimed at examining student performance and the validity of the tasks as a measure of argumentation skills. More than 100 middle school students completed this assessment and additional external measures of argumentation in a pre/post design. Descriptive statistics of student performance in the activities, analyses of item difficulty, and correlations are reported. Results indicated that students' total scores were significantly correlated with external measures of argumentation skills, and with students' state reading and writing test scores. In addition, students achieved higher average scores in a post-test of argumentation skills after having completed the Seaball activities. Finally, explanatory feedback about students' task performance was found to be beneficial to those who were "Below" or "Approaching" proficient on the state reading and writing test. We conclude with implications for assessment design and instruction in argumentation.]

AB  - [Designing learning environments with distributed scaffolding—support distributed across different instructional tools, activities, and the teacher—can help support students’ different needs, but a critical question is how the design incorporates the hallmark feature of responsive support. While most material scaffolds in instructional tools are inherently static, teachers can complement support provided in material scaffolds by providing responsive assistance and mediating students’ interactions within their environment to both support and challenge students. Our study explores the interplay between support embedded in instructional materials and scaffolding provided by teachers. We focused on how teachers’ scaffolding complemented the fading material scaffolds in a paper-and-pencil tool and how this combination of support impacted students’ learning of science practices and content. Differences in teachers’ responsive versus static scaffolding moves corresponded with differences in students’ performance as material scaffolds faded in support. One teacher complemented support provided by the material scaffolds by frequently monitoring students’ understanding and providing additional support as needed, even when material scaffolds faded; her students maintained a high level of performance throughout the unit. In contrast, the other teacher tended to extend the static kind of scaffolding found in the instructional materials rather than adapt support to his students’ needs as material scaffolds faded; his students showed a significant decrease in performance over time. Our findings show that the complementarity between responsive scaffolding moves from the teacher and scaffolding embedded in instructional materials is important for effectively supporting the wide range of students’ needs in the classroom.]

AU  - Voet, Michiel
AU  - De Wever, Bram
AB  - [Professional development on inquiry-based learning (IBL) generally draws heavily on the principle of providing instruction in line with what teachers are expected to do in their classroom. So far, however, relatively little is known about how this impacts teachers' educational beliefs, even though these beliefs ultimately determine their classroom behavior. The present study therefore investigates how immersion in inquiry-based learning affects student teachers' beliefs about knowledge goals, in addition to their self-efficacy for inquiry. In total, 302 student history teachers participated in a 4-h long inquiry activity designed within the WISE learning environment, and completed a pre- and posttest right before and after the intervention. Multilevel analyses suggest that the intervention had a significant positive effect on the value that student teachers attributed to procedural knowledge goals, or learning how historical knowledge is constructed, and on student teachers' self-efficacy for conducting inquiries. Despite these general positive results, however, the results also show that the impact of the intervention differed significantly across students. In particular, it appears that immersion in IBL had little effect on a subgroup of 25 student-teachers, who held largely content-oriented beliefs. Based on these findings, the present study discusses a number of implications for professional development on IBL.]

AB  - Political scientists, pundits, and leaders all evince strong beliefs that status matters. Yet this conventional wisdom—really, a hunch—that status matters only gets us so far. In fact, this widespread consensus has obscured a broader and more critical problem: we lack a nuanced understanding of many fundamental questions related to status in international politics.  My theory of status dissatisfaction provides answers to these questions. In place of the traditional focus on status seeking or preferences for status, I examine status <em>concerns</em> that vary over time and context.

AB  - [ABSTRACT This paper describes a system for research on the behaviour of students taking online drills. The system is accessible and free to use for anyone with web access. Based on open source software, the teaching material is licensed under a Creative Commons License. The system has been used for computer-assisted education in statistics, mathematics and fishery science. It offers a unique way to structure and link material, including interactive drills with a purpose of increasing learning rather than mere evaluation. It is of interest to investigate what affects how students learn in such an environment, for example how the system entices students to continue to work. One research question is therefore: When do learners decide to stop requesting drill items? A case study has been conducted including 316 students in an undergraduate course in calculus. Analysis of the data showed that the probability of stopping increases with higher grades but decreases with increased difficulty and the number of questions answered. Also, the probability of stopping decreases if the last question was answered correctly in comparison to when the last question was answered incorrectly.]

We report two case studies conducted within the context of semester-long teacher education courses at an Asian Pacific university. Forty-one graduate students participated in Study I. After the online discussions (both audio-based as well as text-based) had ended, qualitative data via student reflections were collected. Results revealed that audio-based discussions have six distinct perceived affordances compared to text-based ones. Interestingly, despite the reported affordances, more than half of the students reported that they preferred to use a text-based discussion if given a choice. The main reasons for their preference were explored. In Study II, 42 undergraduate students took part. Similar to Study I, participants in Study II also indicated that they felt more comfortable using a text-based discussion. The reasons for their preference were also discussed. Directions for future research are proposed.]

AB  - [Abstract The purpose of this study was to describe the best practices for teaching equine reproduction in an online environment. A Delphi method was used to reach a three-round consensus of suggested best practices employed for teaching lecture- and laboratory-type topics, as well as recommended assessment techniques. The expert panel was formed by an exhaustive worldwide search for instructors currently teaching an online equine reproduction course. Consensus resulted in the following best practices for teaching equine reproduction lecturetype topics: assignments, multiple exams over the course of the semester, lectures that mirror the textbook in logical order, PowerPoint presentations with pictures, quizzes, summary notes, videos, and vocabulary lists. For laboratory-type topics, local area work experience was the sole best practice result. Best practices for student assessment were quizzes and vocabulary lists. Practitioner recommendations centered on assisting faculty in becoming stronger online instructors. Some recommendations included participating in professional development workshops, becoming involved in communities of practices, and exploring other disciplines' successful methods of online instruction. Research recommendations included repetitions of this study involving a larger participant population and a broadened examination of best practices for all laboratory-based animal science disciplines.]

One innovative tool that may help students foster their L2 proficiency, including writing ability, is in-class debate. Debate is commonly associated with oral communication and argumentation skills. However, debate may also offer advantages as an effective vehicle for L2 writing instruction. This study evaluates the effect of a debate intervention on the writing competence of Dutch secondary-school students. The intervention consisted of a number of speaking and writing activities, including case writing and note taking. The study, which employed a pretest-posttest design with a control group, involved 8 classes at 3 secondary schools in the Netherlands (N = 146). To measure the effect of the intervention, we analyzed 2 opinion writing tasks produced by the students: just prior to the first debate (pretest) and approximately 10 weeks later (posttest). We used a variety of measures, tapping into different aspects of writing performance, including fluency, syntactic and lexical complexity, accuracy, and cohesion. Multilevel analysis of the data revealed that the students in the intervention group significantly improved on a number of measures in comparison to the control group.]

Results show that the learning activities with the flipped classroom pedagogy can be successfully implemented and conducted in a wholly online course along with time and space flexibility for learners. This study also found that students who watched more pre-recorded video lectures tended to participate in the synchronous learning activities more actively and obtained a higher semester grade; higher completion of asynchronous learning activities had benefited students' understanding of the learning concepts. Furthermore, students who had a high level of readiness by attending synchronous class sessions on time and keeping their webcams activated had more frequent and proactive interactions with their peers and instructor.]

AB  - [Digital technologies are increasingly common in language learning. Online media creation provides scope for agency and spaces for identity construction, but empirically grounded conceptualizations of the influences on learners' motivation are lacking and the digital technology-second language motivation interface remains largely unexplored. Using a grounded theory ethnographic approach (Charmaz, 2006), and with the aim of developing a theoretical account of the emergence of motivation in online media creation, this study investigated a blog project in an English language classroom in Sweden. Engaging with multiple data sources, and using Ito and colleagues' (2010) theory of participation in media practices as an analytical framework, motivation is conceptualized as stemming from the desire to create a visually appealing and authentic artefact, from a perception of audience, and through the documentation of identities. Variations in motivational intensity between student groups could be traced to varying investments in digital media practices. Primarily, differences were between validation-seeking that was locally oriented and validation-seeking conditioned through actions within a genre of practice. These conceptualizations are of importance for English language teaching. In language-developing activities that involve online media creation, motivation can be enhanced when space for genre exploration is provided.]

TI  - Enhancing instructor credibility and immediacy in online multimedia designs
AU  - Ramlatchan, Miguel

AB  - [The design of multimedia elements used in video for online courses can increase student perceptions of their instructor’s credibility and immediacy. Credibility is the learner’s perception of the subject matter expertise of the instructor, while immediacy is the learner’s perception of the instructor’s ability to communicate and reduce physiological distance. This experiment randomly assigned research participants (N = 211) into one of five independent treatment groups, each group viewed a different design based on the same subject matter, instructor video, audio narration, and presentation slides. These presentation designs included an instructor-only, slides-only, video-switching, dual-windows, and a superimposed-slides multimedia design variation. A series of 5×1 Analyses of variances and Tukey post hoc calculations were conducted to test for statistically significant differences between groups. The results suggest that a balance can be established between instructor credibility and immediacy by showing both the instructor and instructional content during online classes.]

AB  - [ABSTRACT This study reports on the differences in motivation, vocabulary gain, and perceptions on using or the Google Docs between individual and collaborative learning at a tertiary level. Two classes of English-as-a-Foreign Language (EFL) students were recruited and each class was randomly assigned into one of the two groups - individuals or collaborators. The results of the study are in line with those of previous studies in that the collaborators performed better than the individuals regarding vocabulary gain. The former was more likely than the latter to be motivated to acquire knowledge and to perceive the learning experience more positively. However, the results of this study suggest that, like many other Web 2.0 applications in support of peer scaffolding and knowledge co-construction, Google Docs plays a pivotal role in enhancing students' motivation and involvement.]

AB  - Pre-service teachers from various disciplines undertook a writing assignment in response to an initial prompt related to movie reviews. The movie review genre allowed the student teachers to demonstrate their artistic talents as communicators and writers and enhanced engagement as they applied the activity to planning lessons for their future teaching assignments. This article describes the steps used in the movie review strategy alongside an example lesson plan that illustrates how one pre-service teacher applied the strategy for teaching social studies. Instructors at all levels can use movie reviews to connect academic literacy practices to popular culture in an authentic way.

AB  - <em>Assessment</em> is the process through which a mental health professional gathers, evaluates, and integrates information about the client to arrive at a diagnosis of a mental health disorder and a conceptualization of his or her clinical presentation. <em>Information gathering</em> means that the mental health professional acquires “data” to develop a thorough understanding of the client’s current and past life circumstances, stressors, strengths, and reasons for seeking treatment. As is described in more detail in the next section, data collection can be formal, such as through the administration of a well-validated psychological test, or informal, such as through a free-flowing conversation

AB  - [Research in International Relations (IR) frequently confronts claims about the emotions shared by members of a group. While much attention has been devoted to the potential for affective and emotional experience beyond the individual level IR scholars have said less about the politics of invoking popular emotion. This article addresses that gap. Specifically, we argue that between individual—and even shared—affective experience on the one hand and group-based "popular emotion" on the other exists not mechanisms of aggregation but rather processes of framing, projection, and propagation that are deeply political. We distinguish between two tropes that commonly structure references to popular emotion: communal emotion, the idealized attribution of an authentic, unifying emotional response of "the people" and mass emotion, a volatile and potentially dangerous mob-like reaction, but one also susceptible to manipulation. Using the outbreak of World War I as a showcase, we demonstrate the political significance of popular emotion, including its enduring relevance for understanding contemporary populism.]

AU  - Bialystok, Ellen
AB  - This study examined executive control in sixty-two 5-year-old children who were monolingual or bilingual using behavioral and event-related potentials (ERPs) measures. All children performed equivalently on simple response inhibition (gift delay), but bilingual children outperformed monolinguals on interference suppression and complex response inhibition (go/no-go task). On the go/no-go task, ERPs showed larger P3 amplitudes and shorter N2 and P3 latencies for bilingual children than for monolinguals. These latency and amplitude data were associated with better behavioral performance and better discrimination between stimuli for bilingual children but not for monolingual children. These results clarify the conditions that lead to advantages for bilingual children in executive control and provide the first evidence linking those performance differences to electrophysiological brain differences in children.

AB  - Relational reasoning is the foundational cognitive ability to discern meaningful patterns within an informational stream, but its reliable and valid measurement remains problematic. In this investigation, the measurement of relational reasoning unfolded in three stages. Stage 1 entailed the establishment of a research-based conceptualization of the construct and the development of a corresponding Test of Relational Reasoning (TORR). Stage 2 focused on the reliability and validity of data from the TORR. Analyses showed the data from the TORR to be reliable indicators of students' ability to reason relationally, and TORR performance predicted students' performance on SAT verbal and math problems. Stage 3 examined the underlying structure of the construct through Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). Of the three CFA models tested, models with dedicated factors for analogical, anomalous, antinomous, and antithetical reasoning were deemed the best fit for the data.

AB  - [This study investigated the effectiveness of visible-annotation types used in online discussions to enhance the accuracy of shared knowledge and the level of constructed knowledge in computer-supported collaborative learning environments. Three types of visible-annotation were developed specifically for this study, which had the function of linking learners' annotations to related learning content. The participants were randomly assigned into one of three groups. Each group was provided with different types of visible annotations for building shared knowledge in computer-supported collaborative learning: the TL-type for two content-understanding learning phases; the TLL-type for one concept-understanding learning phase and one content-understanding learning phase; and the C-type for one content-understanding learning phase. After completing the knowledge-sharing stage, the accuracy of the participants' shared knowledge was measured. During the knowledge-construction stage, the participants carried out a lesson-planning task in pairs and constructed knowledge was analyzed based on the lesson plan. The findings revealed that the TLL-type of visible annotation with one concept-understanding learning phase and one content-understanding learning phase was the most effective for enhancing the accuracy of shared knowledge and the level of constructed knowledge in the computer-supported collaborative learning environment.]

AB  - [Free online courses, including Massively Open Online Courses, have great potential to increase the inclusiveness of education, but suffer from very high course dropout rates. A study of 172 K-12 students and 114 K-12 teachers taking the same free, online, summertime programming course finds that student and teacher populations have different underlying motivational models that predict rates of persistence in the course despite having generally similar motivational levels. Student persistence is predicted by prior programming knowledge, intrinsic interest in the subject matter, and mastery approach goals. By contrast, teacher persistence is similarly predicted by intrinsic interest, but then also by self-identity as a programmer, performance approach goals, and negatively by performance avoidance goals. This sub-population discrepancy in predictive factors is novel, and may be reflective of differing environmental conditions or internal mechanisms between students and teachers. Future design of free choice learning environments can take these factors into account to increase rates of user persistence for different target user populations.]

TY  - JOUR
AB  - Scholars of teaching and learning recognize that interacting with ideas and acquiring skills involve both cognition and emotion. Based on the premise that the social aspects of a class affect a learner&#x2019;s participation, I argue that informal communication enables students to be thinking and feeling beings and thus is part of building a strong learning community. Teaching online requires us to think differently about communication and how it shapes a learning community. The form and structure of online interactions makes it difficult to curate informal communication that is productive and supports rather than obstructs learning. I draw on my experience teaching 100% online courses and build on the literature about emotion and learning, feminist pedagogy, and online pedagogies to offer a framework for rethinking informal communication in an online learning environment and encourage educators to actively make space for it in their teaching. These moments of informality help a student develop their social presence&#x2014;or the sense that they are a real person&#x2014;which is especially important in distance education.

Next, six deaf adults participated in videotaped, structured interviews. Then four deaf adults participated in videotaped, structured follow-up interviews. Interpretive coding was used in data analysis to establish themes across participants. Five QOL themes, as explained by the participants, emerged from the interviews: (a) Being deaf was integral to who the study participants were. (b) Friends and family were important.

AB  - This study examines epistemic thinking in action in order to shed light on the relation between students' personal epistemologies and their online learning practices. The study is based on observations of the learning behaviors of 6th-grade students (n = 38) during two online inquiry tasks. Data were collected through think-aloud protocols and retrospective epistemic interviews. The study examines how absolutist and evaluativist epistemic perspectives come into play in two key online inquiry strategies&#x2014;evaluation of website trustworthiness and critical integration of multiple online sources. The study explores students' epistemic thinking on the cognitive and metacognitive levels and examines epistemic metacognitive knowledge about both persons and strategies. The findings demonstrate that epistemic thinking plays an important role in online inquiry learning. Participants' epistemic metacognitive knowledge regarding online learning strategies correlated with their epistemic cognition. Evaluativists significantly outperformed absolutists in the integration strategy but no significant differences were found in the evaluation strategy. Furthermore, there was evidence for considerable variability in students' epistemic thinking. The complex role of students' epistemic thinking in online learning is analyzed and discussed.

We compared environments featuring multiple modes of interaction (MUVEs), shared representations (text chat and 2D still images) and text-only features. Sixty-one students enrolled in an undergraduate course on Child Development participated in the study. Participants were asked to design a theoretically-based, developmentally appropriate, preschool classroom setting. Students were randomly assigned to one of three online learning environments that provided varying levels of representation and interaction. Significant differences in collaborative problem solving interactions were found. Participants in the shared representations + text condition evidenced stronger learning outcomes as regards substantive discussion and integration of child development concepts; while participants in the MUVE condition reported the most enjoyment with the experience. These findings are explained by the concepts of representational guidance, representational bias, educational affordances and interface design metaphors. Suggestions for the design of MUVEs for collaborative learning are provided.]

TI  - Exploring the Effects of Tool-Assisted Paraphrasing Strategy Instruction on EFL Learners’ Paraphrasing Performance
AU  - Cheng, Ying-Hsueh
AB  - [Many students who study English as a foreign language (EFL) often find it challenging to paraphrase while writing from source texts. Lacking such an ability can lead to different meanings as well as copying another person’s ideas, words or work. However, little research has been done to integrate tool consultation to assist students in paraphrasing. To address this gap, this study explored whether guided tool consultation with paraphrasing strategy instruction can help students improve their overall paraphrasing performance. During an 18-week course, a class of students were trained to use three different e-tools to find synonyms: Microsoft Word thesaurus, Oxford Living Dictionaries synonyms (now called Thesaurus.com), and Linggle. Adopting a mixed-method approach, data sets included: pre-posttest drafts (summary writing), surveys, screen recordings, and interviews. The results showed significant differences between the pre- and post-tests. The majority of the lexical and phrasal paraphrases was suitable, while only a few were inaccurate. The students demonstrated the ability to consult the tools for changing synonyms and were able to apply taught strategies to restructure and restate the original sentences. Although students revealed different perceptions of the usefulness of the three tools for finding synonyms, they generally agreed that paraphrasing strategies combined with tool training were beneficial for learning. Pedagogical implications and research suggestions are provided based on the findings.]

AB  - [Beliefs about knowledge have been found to relate to a variety of student outcomes and to vary across educational domains and instructional contexts. However, there are limited data on students' beliefs about information and truth, vis-à-vis knowledge (i.e., epistemic beliefs) and how these beliefs differ across instructional settings. Undergraduates from two educational contexts, in the USA (n = 240) and the Netherlands (n = 72), participated in this study. While students in the USA were enrolled primarily in lecture and discussion classes, students in the Netherlands followed a problem-based learning curriculum. Beliefs about knowledge, information, and truth and their interrelations were examined across these two contexts through graphical and written justification tasks. Results from this exploratory study indicate that Dutch students were more likely than American students to depict knowledge, information, and truth as subjective and to define knowledge and information as synonymous. Commonalities and differences associated with educational backgrounds are considered in relation to instructional implications.]

AU  - Oliveira, Alandeom W.
AB  - [This study explores how elementary teachers perceive and use engaging oral strategies (i. e., manners of speaking that encourage students to participate and become engaged in science discussions). It is reported that the strategies employed as well as their frequency varied substantially depending upon on the teachers' grade level and perceptions. While a kindergarten teacher viewed such strategies negatively and employed only a few figurative directives, fourth-grade teachers viewed them positively, frequently resorting to a variety of speech figures, parallel repetition and engaging questions. It is argued that teachers' engaging oral strategies are multifunctional, serving important social and cognitive functions.]

AU  - Mason, Lucia
AU  - Boldrin, Angela

AB  - [Students are making an increased use of the Web as a source for solving information problems for academic assignments. To extend current research about search behavior during navigation on the Web, this study examined whether students are able to spontaneously reflect, from an epistemic perspective, on the information accessed, and whether their epistemic metacognition is related to individual characteristics, such as prior knowledge of the topic and the need for cognition. In addition, we investigated whether Internet-based learning is influenced by the activation of spontaneous epistemic metacognition in the search context. Forty-six psychology and engineering university students were asked to research information about a controversial subject in order to write an essay. They were also asked to think aloud during their research. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed. As revealed by their spontaneous reflections, all participants were epistemically active, although to different extents and levels. As expected, there was evidence that students activated beliefs about the four epistemic dimensions identified in the literature, especially about the credibility of an electronic source and the criteria for justification of knowledge. Prior knowledge was not related to activation of epistemic beliefs in the search context, while the need for cognition significantly associated with aspects of source and its content evaluation. Two patterns of epistemic metacognition were identified and they significantly influenced Internet-based learning. Students who spontaneously generated more sophisticated reflections about the sources as well as the information provided, outperformed students who were active only at the first epistemic level. Educational implications are drawn.]

AB  - [Graphical representations are frequently used but normally not explicitly taught in social studies. The authors explore how to utilize the often unused potential of disciplinary graphical representations in student writing by offering insight into a Norwegian ninth-grade classroom where students were scaffolded to use such representations. The authors scrutinized how these students invented connections between modes as they combined and transformed different representations in their texts. The authors found high density but not necessarily critical use of visuals. Texts designed with spatial and linear structures integrated visuals and verbal differently. The students’ main challenges concerned cohesion, redundancy, and utilization of modal affordances to communicate their message to a particular audience. To build students’ graphical literacy in social studies over time, the authors recommend overt instruction with model texts, critically framed with an emphasis on affordances and functions, and giving students opportunities to use this knowledge in a social studies practice.]

AB  - Enhver undersøgelse, herunder også effektfuldhedsundersøgelser i pædagogiske sammenhænge, må som udgangspunkt identificere, hvad der undersøges – altså vælge et tema eller en flerhed heraf. Identificeringen vil være forskellig på tværs af undersøgelser og afhænger af, hvilken konkret pædagogisk indsats der udgør genstandsfeltet, og hvilket tema der er koblet hertil. Dermed kan effektfuldhedsundersøgelser tematisk fokusere på trivsel, motivation, relationer, engagement, inklusion, eller hvad end pædagogikken omhandler. Men ofte er læring et centralt tema, fordi mange pædagogiske indsatser og pædagogik generelt er rettet mod udvikling af mennesker, med henblik på at de lærer noget forudbestemt.

AB  - [The purpose of this article is to explore the scope of available evidence regarding the use of interactive e-texts and their relationship to student learning experiences in post-secondary education. Following the framework of Arksey and O’Malley, this scoping review identified and reported on 33 articles. Study characteristics are presented alongside four themes that were found across the included articles: (1) the effect of interactive e-texts on student learning experiences; (2) the relationship between interactive e-texts and academic performance; (3) factors influencing student adoption and experience of interactive e-texts; and (4) roles, responsibilities, and recommendations. While the adoption of interactive e-texts is becoming increasingly common in post-secondary education, their effect on student learning experiences remains complex. This review emphasizes the importance of user-friendliness, affordability, accessibility, portability, and the role of educators. Using interactive e-texts shows promise, though future research should explore how barriers might be minimized and benefits might be maximized to have the strongest impact on student learning experiences. L’objectif de cet article était d’explorer l’étendue des connaissances disponibles sur l’utilisation des documents numériques interactifs et leur relation avec les expériences d’apprentissage des étudiants à l’enseignement supérieur. Suivant le cadre de l’étude d’Arksey et O’Malley (2005), cet examen de l’étendue des connaissances nous a permis de repérer et d’analyser 33 articles. Les caractéristiques de l’étude sont présentées selon quatre thèmes retrouvés dans les articles consultés : (1) l’impact des documents numériques interactifs sur les expériences d’apprentissage des étudiants; (2) la relation entre les documents numériques interactifs et les résultats scolaires; (3) les facteurs influençant l’adoption des documents numériques interactifs et les expériences d’utilisation par les étudiants; et (4) les rôles, les responsabilités et les recommandations. Tandis que l’utilisation des documents numériques interactifs devient de plus en plus fréquente au postsecondaire, leur impact sur les expériences d’apprentissage des étudiants demeure complexe. Cet article souligne l’importance de la convivialité, du coût, de l’accessibilité, de la portabilité et du rôle des enseignants. Puisque l’utilisation de documents numériques interactifs est prometteuse, de futures recherches devraient explorer comment les obstacles pourraient être réduits au minimum et les avantages maximisés pour permettre le meilleur impact possible sur les expériences d’apprentissage des étudiants.]

AU  - Peterson, Emily Grossnickle
AU  - Cohen, Jana
AB  - [Epistemic curiosity is a desire for knowledge accompanied by positive emotions, increased arousal, and exploratory behavior (Grossnickle, Educational Psychology Review, 28(1), 23–60, 2016). Although curiosity has typically been characterized as a domain-general construct, domain-general conceptualizations do not acknowledge systematic changes in an individuals' development (e.g., domain knowledge) as they advance within a domain. Moreover, a domaingeneral conceptualization of curiosity stands in direct contrast to research on interest, given that interest is typically described as domain-specific (e.g., interest for mathematics). Without a domain-specific conceptualization of curiosity as it relates to development within academic domains, comparisons between curiosity and interest will remain muddled. In the present theoretical review, we put forward a conceptualization of curiosity as domain-specific and examine how the components of curiosity develop within one academic domain: mathematics. In doing so, we juxtapose conceptualizations of epistemic curiosity with literature related to the development of other epistemic factors (i.e., knowledge, epistemic beliefs) in mathematics. Specifically, we build on the knowledge gap theories of epistemic curiosity (Litman, Personality and Individual Differences, 48(4), 397-410, 2010; Loewenstein, Psychological Bulletin, 116(1), 75-98, 1994) to consider developmental shifts in (a) knowledge gaps, (b) heightened arousal, and (c) exploratory behaviors within the domain of mathematics. Understanding the domain-specific and developmental nature of curiosity is critical for distinguishing curiosity from interest and for supporting motivation within mathematics classrooms.]

AB  - [The purpose of this project was to develop theoretical constructs and instructional design elements related to improving students' ability to learn through writing. The authors used a design experiment approach to develop an instructional model to improve students' ability to use writing as a learning tool. This model, developed by Bereiter and Scardamalia, posits that a dialectic between solving rhetorical problems and solving content problems can transform the writer's knowledge. The framework initially included frequent writing in the content areas, a conception of writing as learning, education in analytic genres (i.e., arguments, explanations), development of intrinsic motivation to write, strategies for the constructive use of sources, evaluation and revision for learning, assessment designed to support self-evaluation, and remediation of mechanics. The two phases of the study focused on argument writing and explanation writing in the content areas, respectively. Each phase included several cycles of (a) implementing the design elements, (b) monitoring students' texts for evidence of the knowledge transforming process, and (c) revising our theory-in-action and modifying the design elements of the framework. In a series of posttest activities, the experimental class showed a significantly greater ability to learn during writing than a comparison class, as well as significantly greater argument genre knowledge, explanation genre knowledge, and explanation text quality.]

AB  - [Team-Based Learning (TBL) is a highly structured, immersive teaching strategy that emphasizes active learning through peer teams. Despite its many potential benefits for teaching introductory sociology, it has been slow to gain traction in the discipline. Instructors may debate whether the value of TBL is sufficient to justify its challenges, which may include student resistance, increased time demands, and difficulty envisioning implementation. We aim to resolve this debate in four ways by (1) familiarizing faculty with the TBL method, (2) examining the value of TBL for students and instructors, (3) discussing strategies for overcoming challenges, and (4) offering an example of how TBL can be implemented in an introductory sociology course. As the scholarship of teaching and learning continues to challenge faculty to implement forward-thinking teaching techniques that move beyond traditional lecture, we conclude that TBL offers a compelling framework for transforming the introductory sociology course.]

AB  - [We engaged 47 eighth-grade students in a newly developed learning environment that integrates mobile augmented reality (AR) technology to support students’ learning of nuclear energy use and radiation pollution, a topic related to a socioscientific issue (SSI) that involves complex reasoning considering scientific evidence and multiple perspectives. We employ the partial least squares structural equation modeling to investigate how the students’ context-specific epistemic justification and prior knowledge contributed to their engagement in the learning environment and socioscientific reasoning (SSR) performance after the learning. Data collected include students’ responses to the knowledge pretest that assessed students’ prior knowledge related to the SSI, the pretest survey that measured students’ context-specific epistemic justifications, the Cognitive and Emotional Engagement Survey (CEES) right after the end of the AR activities that measured students’ self-reported cognitive and emotional engagement, and the posttest that measured students’ socioscientific reasoning performance. The results indicate that students’ context-specific epistemic justifications can predict their engagement in the environment, and that prior knowledge and belief in justification by authority can predict students’ SSR performance, but in different directions. The results provide insights into how to support students with different personal characteristics to learn with AR technology about SSI, and contribute to a model of personal epistemology within the environment of integrating AR technology for the learning of SSI.]

Available print materials in 15 classrooms (5 per grade) and time spent with texts in written language activities were coded and analyzed by text type following Duke's (2000) data-collection procedures. The proportion of informational text in classrooms was slightly higher in grade 2; in classroom environmental print it was highest in grade 3, followed by grade 4 and then grade 2; in classroom written language activities it showed a marked increase from grades 2 to 3, with that increase sustained in grade 4. Total instructional time with informational text was an average of 1 minute in grade 2 and 16 minutes in grades 3 and 4.

AB  - [This paper presents a secondary analysis of data collected during an intervention study in which students learnt to synthesise pairs of texts presenting opposite views on controversial issues. The original intervention study included two treatments and examined the effects of two instruction conditions when instructional materials and tasks were held constant. The participants were 114 undergraduate psychology students. The object of the instruction was a guide on strategies for writing an argumentative synthesis text. However, the instruction varied between explicit strategy instruction, consisting of explaining each of the process’s four phases (exploring and identifying arguments and counterarguments, contrasting positions, drawing an integrative conclusion, and organising and revising the final draft), modelled via videos, versus self-study of the written strategy guide. After the initial instruction session, the students in both groups practiced collaboratively writing synthesis texts over two sessions with access to the strategy guide. The primary study compared the individually written pre- and posttest syntheses and found statistically significant differences favouring explicit instruction in both dependent variables: the argumentation coverage and the level of integration. The secondary analysis reported in the current paper involved scoring additional written syntheses produced during two practice sessions and then analysing the data for all time points (pretest, posttest, and the two practice sessions) using structural equation modelling (SEM) to test whether explicit instruction directly or indirectly affected the two indicators of good argumentative synthesis texts—argument coverage and integration—via the following collaborative practice. The results suggested two different learning paths for both dependent variables: explicit instruction is effective for both variables, while collaborative practice only has an additional indirect effect on argument coverage.]

AB  - [An extensive body of research has investigated the role of syntactic complexity in gauging the linguistic complexity of reading texts, particularly for the purpose of determining their grade appropriateness. However, little such research has focused on adapted teaching materials for English as a foreign language (EFL) contexts, and to date there has been no systematic effort in establishing syntactic complexity benchmarks to guide text adaptation practices in such contexts. This paper reports on a large-scale study that assessed the quantitative differences in syntactic complexity among adapted teaching materials for different grade levels in the EFL curricula in China. Our data consisted of 3,368 adapted English texts solicited from a corpus of teaching materials approved for use in the 12 primary and secondary grade levels in China by the Chinese Ministry of Education. All texts were analyzed using 8 syntactic complexity measures representing different dimensions of syntactic complexity. All 8 measures showed significant between-level differences with moderate to large effect sizes and nonuniform patterns of progression, and 5 measures were identified as significant predictors of grade levels in a logistic regression analysis. The implications of our results for establishing syntactic complexity benchmarks to inform future text adaptation practices are discussed.]

TI  - Conditions for the Effectiveness of Multiple Visual Representations in Enhancing STEM Learning
AU  - Rau, Martina A.
AB  - [Visual representations play a critical role in enhancing science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) learning. Educational psychology research shows that adding visual representations to text can enhance students' learning of content knowledge, compared to text-only. But should students learn with a single type of visual representation or with multiple different types of visual representations? This article addresses this question from the perspective of the representation dilemma, namely that students often learn content they do not yet understand from representations they do not yet understand. To benefit from visual representations, students therefore need representational competencies, that is, knowledge about how visual representations depict information about the content. This article reviews literature on representational competencies involved in students' learning of content knowledge. Building on this review, this article analyzes how the number of visual representations affects the role these representational competencies play during students' learning of content knowledge. To this end, the article compares two common scenarios: text plus a single type of visual representations (T+SV) and text plus multiple types of visual representations (T+MV). The comparison yields seven hypotheses that describe under which conditions T+MV scenarios are more effective than T+SV scenarios. Finally, the article reviews empirical evidence for each hypothesis and discusses open questions about the representation dilemma.]

AB  - [Purpose: This study explores whether follower perceived need-supply (N-S) job fit, demand-ability (D-A) job fit, and person-organization (P-O) fit mediate the relationships between individual-level, unit-level transformational leadership (TFL), and follower task performance. Design/Methodology/Approach: Data were collected from multiple sources, comprised 85 leaders and 343 followers in 85 bank branches. Hierarchical linear modeling analysis (HLM) was employed to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings: Our results indicate that both individual-level and unit-level TFL positively predict follower task performance. In addition, follower N-S and D-A job fit perceptions mediate the association between individual-level TFL and task performance. However, follower P-O fit perception did not mediate the unit-level TFL-performance linkage. Implications: Our results show that: (1) TFL is positively related to follower task performance; (2) TFL is positively associated with follower N-S and D-A job fit perceptions; and (3) follower perceived fit with their job (e.g., N-S and D-A job fit) positively predicts their task performance. Originality/Value: Leadership researchers have attempted to clarify the mechanisms linking TFL and follower task performance. However, whether follower fit perceptions toward the job and the organization explain this association has been neglected in past studies. This study contributes to the leadership and fit literature by examining the mediating roles of follower perceived N-S job fit, D-A job fit, and P-O fit within the TFL-follower task performance link.]

AB  - [Until recently, museums mainly communicated well-established knowledge. Current science, however, is characterized by a rapid knowledge increase, so that we often have to deal with fragile and inconsistent knowledge. In order to develop exhibitions that encourage visitors to process information in a differentiated way, museums need to know how visitors deal with conflicting information. Furthermore, museum professionals need information on personal and situational factors that may promote the processing of such information. We tested whether conflict processing is influenced by personal characteristics such as situational interest, epistemological beliefs, tolerance of ambiguity, and self-efficacy on the one hand and by situational conditions such as the spatial arrangement of information on the other hand. In two science museums and one museum of cultural history, text pairs were displayed that described a topic from conflicting perspectives. The spatial distance between the two texts was manipulated. Semi-structured interviews and questionnaires captured the personal characteristics of 323 visitors and the way they dealt with conflicting information. The results showed that a majority of the visitors perceived a conflict, and a large proportion was willing to process the information at a deeper level. Sophisticated epistemological beliefs, a high tolerance of ambiguity, and high self-efficacy were found to promote situational interest in conflicting information. High situational interest, in turn, promoted a tendency to process deeply. Placing text pairs in close proximity had a positive effect on the processing depth in science museums but not in the museum of cultural history. A possible explanation lies in the higher density of additional and potentially interfering information in the science museums compared to the museum of cultural history.]

AB  - In the research reported here, we examined whether task demands can induce momentary tunnel vision during reading. More specifically, we examined whether the size of the functional visual field depends on task relevance. Forty participants read an expository text with a specific task in mind while their eye movements were recorded. A display-change paradigm with random-letter strings as preview masks was used to study the size of the functional visual field within sentences that contained task-relevant and task-irrelevant information. The results showed that orthographic parafoveal-on-foveal effects and preview benefits were observed for words within task-irrelevant but not task-relevant sentences. The results indicate that the size of the functional visual field is flexible and depends on the momentary processing demands of a reading task. The higher cognitive processing requirements experienced when reading task-relevant text rather than task-irrelevant text induce momentary tunnel vision, which narrows the functional visual field.

AB  - [Preservice teachers face the challenge of integrating multiple types of knowledge, such as pedagogical–psychological knowledge and subject-specific pedagogical knowledge. We investigated whether prior instruction emphasizing the importance of knowledge integration (relevance instruction) supports preservice teachers in using both knowledge types simultaneously. Seventy-two preservice music teachers participated in this computer-based study. They worked on two separate lectures about learners’beliefs. One lecture contained pedagogical–psychological knowledge; the other contained music-specific pedagogical knowledge. The preservice teachers received either a relevance instruction before starting a new lecture or a control instruction. We found that the relevance instruction increased the simultaneous use of the two knowledge types in scenario-based tasks. In these tasks, the preservice teachers needed to provide interpretations and decisions for excerpts describing various classroom situations. The relevance instruction increased the time that the preservice teachers spent on the lectures slightly; but it did not increase the perceived task difficulty or mental effort. Furthermore, the effect of the relevance instruction was not moderated by prior knowledge. We conclude that relevance instructions are a promising approach to fostering knowledge integration in teacher education.]

AB  - Finding materials to help students make connections is difficult for many teachers across all grade levels. Traditionally, the textbook is the primary resource for instruction. Textbooks, however, do not naturally support students in making connections across texts. To do this, teachers must find other resources. Finding other resources is particularly important at this time because many teachers are becoming increasingly aware of the need for students to learn how to make connections across texts. Teachers feel a sense of urgency because of the Common Core State Standards (National Governors Association Center for Best Practices and Council of Chief State School Officers, 2010). One standard in particular requires that students should be able to analyze two or more texts for a variety of purposes: to build knowledge, examine similarities and differences in the approaches authors take, and make connections between themes and topics, events, and characters of texts. This process of making connections between and across texts is often referred to as intertextuality. During the intertextual process, readers make connections with past readings, prior ideas, and previous literary experiences to construct an evolving text (Chi, 2012). In other words, intertextuality posits that no text ever stands alone; rather, every text is connected to other texts. The challenge is this: How can teachers teach intertextuality? How can teachers help students make connections across texts and also across content areas? This article presents lessons learned from our collaborative inquiry project into the world of intertextuality.

However, little is known about the impact and utility of immersive VR for administering e-learning tools, or the underlying mechanisms that impact learners' emotional processes while learning. This paper explores whether differences exist with regard to using either immersive or desktop VR to administer a virtual science learning simulation. We also investigate how the level of immersion impacts perceived learning outcomes using structural equation modeling. The sample consisted of 104 university students (39 females). Significantly higher scores were obtained on 11 of the 13 variables investigated using the immersive VR version of the simulation, with the largest differences occurring with regard to presence and motivation. Furthermore, we identified a model with two general paths by which immersion in VR impacts perceived learning outcomes. Specifically, we discovered an affective path in which immersion predicted presence and positive emotions, and a cognitive path in which immersion fostered a positive cognitive value of the task in line with the control value theory of achievement emotions.]

The strengths and limitations of contemporary approaches to text complexity are discussed with respect to major points raised in the six articles in this special issue. In addition, four features of text that are of central importance for reading to learn disciplinary content are discussed: topic complexity, genre and function, word-level indicators, and task complexity. We argue that if we are to ascertain sources of complexity and challenge when readers engage with text for purposes of accomplishing interpretive and explanatory levels of understanding, we will need to take into account text, task, and reader situated in sociocultural contexts of schools and communities.

AU  - Shreiner, Tamara L.
AB  - People often justify history's place in the curriculum by its relationship to citizenship, yet there is little research to help educators picture how people use historical knowledge for civic purposes. This expert-novice study used the think-aloud method to examine how eight political scientists and eight high school students employed historical knowledge to reason about a political issue. Findings indicated that detailed historical narrative played an important role for experts' reasoning, and the experts used narrative to frame the issue, support their positions, and evaluate historical claims. Participating students used narrative as well, but their narratives were lacking in detail. They never used history to frame the problem, contextualize documents, or to support their positions, and they rarely used narrative to evaluate claims. These differences in how experts and novices use history to make sense of the present have implications for history instruction and research in history and civic education.

AB  - [The purpose of this study is to examine the moderating role of cognitive load experience between students' scientific epistemic beliefs and information commitments, which refer to online evaluative standards and online searching strategies. A total of 344 science-related major students participated in this study. Three questionnaires were used to ascertain the students' scientific epistemic beliefs, information commitments, and cognitive load experience. Structural equation modeling was then used to analyze the moderating effect of cognitive load, with the results revealing its significant moderating effect. The relationships between sophisticated scientific epistemic beliefs and the advanced evaluative standards used by the students were significantly stronger for low than for high cognitive load students. Moreover, considering the searching strategies that the students used, the relationships between sophisticated scientific epistemic beliefs and advanced searching strategies were also stronger for low than for high cognitive load students. However, for the high cognitive load students, only one of the sophisticated scientific epistemic belief dimensions was found to positively associate with advanced evaluative standard dimensions.]

AB  - [Blended learning (BL) is regarded as an effective strategy for combining traditional face-to-face classroom activities with various types of online learning tools (e.g., e-books). An effective feature of e-books is the ability to use digital notes. When e-books are used in BL, the strategic adoption of note-taking provides benefit that influence the learner' progress for self-regulated learning (SRL) and course achievements. However, learners tend to be unsure about how note-taking is performed using online learning materials and lack sequential patterns of e-book note-taking for SRL. Thus, in this paper, an exploratory study was conducted in an undergraduate course that implemented the BL design. The learning task for the blended learners in the present study was to study the learning material using BookRoll, an e-book system, during in-class and out-of-class learning sessions. Lag sequential analysis of the e-book learning behavior data was conducted to identify the blended learners' sequential behaviors of e-book note-taking for the cognitive strategy use of SRL. Moreover, the difference between higher- and lower-achievement blended learners in terms of their sequential behaviors of e-book note-taking for SRL was revealed. This study can help educators provide evidence-based educational feedback to learners regarding the identified sequential patterns of e-book note-taking that can be applied as effective strategies for promoting the cognitive strategy use of SRL and improvement of course achievement in BL.]

TI  - Developing and Enacting Pedagogical Content Knowledge for Teaching History: An Exploration of Two Novice Teachers' Growth Over Three Years
AU  - Monte-Sano, Chauncey

AB  - Using artifacts of teachers' practices, classroom observations, and teacher interviews, we explore the development and enactment of 2 novices' pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) for teaching history. We identify and track 4 components of PCK that are relevant to teaching history: representing history, transforming history, attending to students' ideas about history, and framing history. We find that these 2 novices demonstrated different aspects of PCK in different settings at different points in the first 3 years of their careers. Their PCK continued to grow after preservice education, although the pace and substance of this development varied. In particular, attending to students' ideas about history and framing history were more challenging aspects of PCK for these novices. Specific features of the teacher education program, the school context, and the individual teacher's capacity facilitate growth in PCK, including opportunities to practice, alignment within the teacher education program and across learning sites, reflection on practice, and subject matter knowledge. "A very learned man may profoundly understand a subject himself, and yet fail egregiously in elucidating it to others."&#x2014; 1861 petition to the California Superintendent of Public Instruction by the Committee on State Normal Schools (as quoted in McDiarmid & Clevenger-Bright, 2008, p. 134)

AB  - This exploratory quasi-experimental investigation describes the influence of text signals on team visual map artifacts. In two course sections, four-member teams were given one of two print-based text passage versions on the course-related topic "Social influence in groups" downloaded from Wikipedia; this text had two paragraphs, each with a prominent heading. Teams in one section (10 teams, 40 participants) were given the version that included the original hyperlinks (HTS) displayed as underlining, while teams in the other section (nine teams, 36 participants) were given an alternate version with the hyperlinks removed but with the same number of important text topics underlined (TTS). Participants worked during class time to create team visual maps of this passage using large sheets of newsprint. Both headings and text topic terms predominated in the TTS team maps, but only hyperlink terms and not headings predominated in the HTS team maps. The team visual map forms, as measured by vector pattern matching and by graph centrality, were also significantly different. Relative to the HTS team maps, on average the TTS team map forms were more complex and more like the expert's map, while the HTS team map forms were more linear, showing a primacy effect. Further, the HTS team maps were substantially more alike. These results indicate that text signals in these print-based readings strongly influenced team collaboration artifacts.

AB  - [This paper briefly reports the outcomes of an action research inquiry on the use of blogs, MS PowerPoint [PPT], and the Internet as learning tools with a science class of sixth graders for project-based learning. Multiple sources of data were essential to triangulate the key findings articulated in this paper. Corresponding to previous studies, the incorporation of technology and project-based learning could motivate students in self-directed exploration. The students were excited about the autonomy over what to learn and the use of PPT to express what they learned. Differing from previous studies, the findings pointed to the lack information literacy among students. The students lacked information evaluation skills, notetaking and information synthesis. All these findings imply the importance of teaching students about information literacy and visual literacy when introducing information technology into the classroom. The authors suggest that further research should focus on how to break the culture of "copy-and-paste" by teaching the skills of note-taking and synthesis through inquiry projects for science learning. Also, further research on teacher professional development should focus on using collaboration action research as a framework for re-designing graduate courses for science teachers in order to enhance classroom technology integration.]

AB  - [This paper describes the development of a software program that supports argumentative reading and writing, especially for novice students. The software helps readers create a graphic organizer from the text as a knowledge map while they are reading and use their prior knowledge to build their own opinion as new information while they think about writing their essays. Readers using this software can read a text, underline important words or sentences, pick up and dynamically cite the underlined portions of the text onto a knowledge map as quotation nodes, illustrate a knowledge map by linking the nodes, and later write their opinion as an essay while viewing the knowledge map; thus, the software bridges argumentative reading and writing. Sixty-three freshman and sophomore students with no prior argumentative reading and writing education participated in a design case study to evaluate the software in classrooms. Thirty-four students were assigned to a class in which each student developed a knowledge map after underlining and/or highlighting a text with the software, while twenty-nine students were assigned to a class in which they simply wrote their essays after underlining and/or highlighting the text without creating knowledge maps. After receiving an instruction regarding a simplified Toulmin's model followed by instructions for the software usage in argumentative reading and writing along with reading one training text, the students read the target text and developed their essays. The results revealed that students who drew a knowledge map based on the underlining and/or highlighting of the target text developed more argumentative essays than those who did not draw maps. Further analyses revealed that developing knowledge maps fostered an ability to capture the target text's argument, and linking students' ideas to the text's argument directly on the knowledge map helped students develop more constructive essays. Accordingly, we discussed additional necessary scaffolds, such as automatic argument detection and collaborative learning functions, for improving the students' use of appropriate reading and writing strategies.]

Participants' concurrent verbal reports of strategy use (i.e., information location, meaning making, source evaluation, self-monitoring) and their reading outcome (i.e., the generated question) were evaluated with scoring rubrics. Path analysis indicated that strategic meaning making coordinated with self-monitoring and source evaluation positively influenced the quality of the generated questions, whereas information-locating strategies alone contributed little to the participants' question generation. Further, source evaluation played a positive role when readers monitored and regulated their strategies for information location and meaning making. The findings on the interplay of metacognitive, critical, and intertextual strategies in online reading are discussed with regard to research and practice.]

Respondents reported spending an average of 17 hours a week on program coordination (σ = 10.59). We estimated high ($43,428.84 to $124,400.64), medium ($26,367.51 to $75,528.96), and low estimates ($9,306.18 to $26,657.28) of program coordination human resource costs across a range of salaries and contract types as well as for the incentives provided to program coordinators. The most common incentive that institutions provide is the course release, which incurs adjunct costs.

AB  - [Many composition teachers employ a process approach that includes a revision component with multiple sources and types of feedback. Most prior research on response to student writing, however, has tended to isolate one specific feedback type (e.g., peer response or teacher commentary) to examine its effects on student writing. In this article, we present a multiple-case study of three international students in a developmental writing class for multilingual students. Our analysis examines their processes in completing a complex, multidraft writing assignment and the ways in which different feedback sources—peer response and writing conferences—influence participants’ revision of their texts. The study combines analyses of interviews, recorded writing conferences, participant journals, and writing samples to trace how changes to drafts were initiated and implemented. The participants utilized varied but overall successful revision processes. All three students applied feedback from their peers and instructor but to different degrees and often based on their attitudes toward that feedback source. We discuss these revision processes in light of the interaction between feedback sources and the lessons learned from the scaffolded assignment sequence.]

AB  - Positive friendships have been related to decreasing levels of children's physical aggression over time. While this evidence calls for interventions aimed at helping children build good-quality friendships, tests of causality through experimental manipulations are still needed. The goal of this study was to examine whether an intervention aimed to increase dyadic friendship quality could decrease children's physical aggression at the peer-group level over a school year. A total of 34 aggressive children and each child's best friend were randomly assigned to two groups: an experimental condition where the members in each dyad participated together in 12 weekly intervention sessions and a no-intervention control condition. Multiple sources were used to evaluate changes in friendship quality and children's physical aggression. Results showed an indirect effect of the intervention on decreasing levels of physical aggression through the improvement of one specific feature of friendship quality: conflict resolution. These results point to the usefulness of including this relational aspect in intervention programs targeting aggressive children.

TI  - Between Veritas and Communitas: Epistemic Switching in the Reading of Academic and Sacred History
AU  - Gottlieb, Eli
AU  - Wineburg, Sam
AB  - We compared how 8 religious believers (historians and clergy) and 8 skeptics (historians and scientists) read a series of documents on 2 topics: the Biblical Exodus and the origins of the first (American) Thanksgiving. Readings by religiously committed historians differed from those of their non-religious peers. Navigating between the competing commitments of their faith communities on the one hand and an academic guild on the other, religious historians engaged in epistemic switching, varying epistemological criteria to align with the allegiances triggered by the document under review. To explain these findings, we propose that historical understanding be conceived not as a unitary construct but as a form of coordination between multiple axes: a vertical axis of increasing intellectual sophistication as defined by the discipline; and a horizontal axis of identification and commitment, along which individuals move between a variety of allegiances and affiliations as they engage the epistemological criteria of sacred history. Implications for future research in the learning sciences are discussed.

Results showed that the text illustrated by either the concrete or the abstract picture led to better learning than did the text alone. Eye-fixation data revealed that the abstract illustration promoted more efficient processing of the text. Analyses of the gaze shifts between the 2 types of external representation indicated that the readers of the text with the abstract illustration made a greater effort to integrate verbal and pictorial information.

AB  - [ABSTRACT The present study investigated the effects of providing subtitles and taking enotes on cognitive load and performance. A total of 73 English-as-a-Foreign-Language (EFL) undergraduates learned brain anatomy and cognitive functions through multimedia programs. We used a 2 (subtitle/no) x 2 (taking enotes/no) factorial design to test the following: (1) if cognitive demand would vary among different groups, and (2) if providing subtitles or taking enotes would facilitate learning. Four versions of multimedia materials had exactly the same content and differed only in the availability of subtitles or enote functions. The enote tool was designed for effective note-taking with regard to video/animation, making it possible to directly link notes to a specific scene. The results indicated that animation with subtitles groups help reduce cognitive load and increase performance. No significant differences were found in either cognitive load or post-performance for those who learned with or without taking enotes. Although previous studies suggest subtitles may lead to a split-attention effect for native learners, we found a dual-coding effect (or reverse split-attention effect) for EFL learners.]

TI  - Argumentation Tasks in Secondary English Language Arts, History, and Science: Variations in Instructional Focus and Inquiry Space
AU  - Litman, Cindy
AU  - Greenleaf, Cynthia
AB  - [This study drew on observations of 40 secondary English language arts, history, and science lessons to describe variation in opportunities for students to engage in argumentation and possible implications for student engagement and learning. The authors focused their analysis on two broad dimensions of argumentation tasks: (1) Instructional focus categorized tasks as learning to argue, arguing to learn, or interactive argumentation focused on evaluating different possible meanings and interpretations of text. (2) Inquiry space described the degree to which the question, possible claims, and knowledge and skills needed to accomplish an argumentation task were predetermined. Findings point to task characteristics as a potentially powerful influence on instruction and resultant student engagement. Although most of the argumentation tasks focused on arguing to learn, the authors found that both arguing-to-learn and learning-to-argue tasks were frequently based on predetermined questions, answers, and content. In contrast, interactive argumentation was generally shaped by student questions and interpretations. Using contrasting illustrations from observed lessons, the authors theorize about the role of inquiry space in argumentation teaching and learning. Given that students' interactive argumentation often revealed important argumentative reasoning, the authors argue for recognizing these activities as argumentation and exploring their potential in the development of argumentation literacy skills.]

In particular, we consider the ways that sociocultural theories of reading and ‘new literacies’ extend the field’s thinking about literacy beyond the classroom/school to include ‘everyday’ literacy settings. Finally, we examine how the concept of extended literacy can be understood as extending conceptions of what it means to read, particularly in an age of digital tools and easy access to information.]

AB  - [A person's speech communicates his or her thoughts and feelings. We predicted that beyond conveying the contents of a person's mind, a person's speech also conveys mental capacity, such that hearing a person explain his or her beliefs makes the person seem more mentally capable&#x2014;and therefore seem to possess more uniquely human mental traits&#x2014;than reading the same content. We expected this effect to emerge when people are perceived as relatively mindless, such as when they disagree with the evaluator's own beliefs. Three experiments involving polarizing attitudinal issues and political opinions supported these hypotheses. A fourth experiment identified paralinguistic cues in the human voice that convey basic mental capacities. These results suggest that the medium through which people communicate may systematically influence the impressions they form of each other. The tendency to denigrate the minds of the opposition may be tempered by giving them, quite literally, a voice.]

Instruction in locating, navigating, organizing, and producing information in the online world is integral to students’ mastery of digital literacy. The authors detail the use of guided inquiry to explore multimodal text sets in a meaningful and collaborative way as a means of providing this instruction. Synthesis of prior research and analysis of study data resulted in the identification of five key principles necessary for effective instruction with multimodal text sets: attending to motivation and engagement, thoughtfully selecting sources, framing instruction as inquiry, supporting student synthesis, and writing for an authentic audience and purpose. These principles can help transform teachers’ instructional practices to meet the needs of today's learners.]

AB  - [The authors examined whether relevance instructions compensate for differences in verbal ability on measures of reading time, text recall, and sentence recognition. College students (n = 81) with higher and lower verbal ability were assigned randomly to 1 of 2 relevance-instruction conditions before reading a text. They asked participants in each condition to focus on different categories of information within the same text. Relevant information took longer to read and was recalled and recognized better than nonrelevant information. Readers with higher verbal ability read faster and recalled and recognized more information correctly than did those readers with lower verbal ability. Results support the noncompensatory hypothesis, which states that relevance instructions and verbal ability make independent contributions to resource allocation and learning. Readers with lower verbal ability may need additional support even when given prereading relevance instructions.]

AB  - [ABSTRACT This study was designed to investigate the benefit of inclusion of various verbal elements in 3D talking-head on pronunciation learning among non-native speakers. In particular, the study examines the effects of three different multimedia presentation strategies in 3D talking-head Mobile-Assisted-Language-Learning (MALL) on the learning achievement of students with low English pronunciation skills. Pre-test and post-test scores were utilized to determine the students' overall performance. 60 college students with low pronunciation skill were involved, in which they were divided into three equal groups of 20 students. Scores obtained were analyzed statistically with one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with the pre-test scores as covariate. The findings revealed that 3D talking-head with spoken text and on-screen text MALL has significant contribution in retaining the correct pronunciation acquisition in comparison with 3D talking-head with spoken-text alone MALL and spoken text with on-screen text MALL. Therefore, it may be concluded that multiple sources of verbal information to identify and decode language input are advantageous for effective pronunciation learning, specifically among non-native speakers.]

AB  - [Much research has been conducted to document and sometimes to provide proximate explanations (e.g., Confucianism vs. Western philosophy) for East—West cultural differences. The ultimate evolutionary mechanisms underlying these cross-cultural differences have not been addressed. We propose in this review that East—West cultural differences (e.g., independent versus interdependent self construal; autonomy versus harmony in values; hierarchical versus egalitarian relationships) result from social learning and individual learning as primary means to adapt to the local environment. Historical and contemporary evidence from multiple sources is reviewed that indicates smaller extents of environmental variability in East Asia including China than in Europe and North America, favoring social learning in the East and individual learning in the West. Corresponding to these different adaptive strategies, East—West differences stem from learning styles that differ between copying and rote memorization, on the one hand, and critical thinking and innovative problem solving, on the other hand. These primary cultural differences are correlated with such personality attributes as conformity, compliance, and independence that serve to facilitate social or individual learning. This and other cross-cultural and educational psychological research is reviewed as evidence to support our evolutionary explanation of why Eastern and Western cultures differ in the ways in which they do.]

Two documents had source-related issues (i.e., noncompetent author, outdated), and the other two documents had content-related issues (i.e., topic mismatch, poor readability). Most students failed to notice the issues, including topic mismatch. The participants also produced inconsistent evaluations of topic match, readability, author competence, and currency. In experiment 2, students were prompted to assess each criterion separately. The participants distinguished poorer from better documents in relation to each criterion, except for author competence.

AB  - To be literate in the 21st century means much more than learning to read and write; it requires advanced skills like collaboration, critical problem solving, and utilizing multiple sources and means of communication. Learning a language, an aspect of becoming literate, demands that learners not only acquire vocabulary and syntax but also use languages, to engage critically in our society. This article examines the lives of new English learners in multilingual contexts, focusing on how school literacy and language practices impact children's thinking about themselves and their literacies. We suggest practices that can positively shape student identities and call educators to construct learning environments that help students become agentive learners capable of critical engagement with the world.

AU  - Garcia, Antero
AB  - [The author explored the literacy practices in tabletop gaming communities. Focusing on the role of spatiality and materiality in nondigital contexts, this study broadens how literacies research engages with sociocultural analysis of primarily analog settings. Building on experiences in playing the roleplaying game Dungeons & Dragons, the author analyzed how literacies shape the collaborative storytelling and interpretation of complex rules mechanics required for play. The author drew on 26 months of collected ethnographic data, including participant observation of hundreds of hours of tabletop role-playing game sessions, interviews, and textual analysis. Describing how gaming literacy practices are enacted, the findings from this study identify three different spaces in which analog literacies often emerge: in-game literacies, at-the-table literacies, and beyond-the-table literacies. Exploring how participants read, produce, and communicate in ways that move across these domains, the author emphasizes the roles of temporality and spatiality in understanding contemporary literacies. Further, as Dungeons & Dragons is mediated by myriad books and physical objects, such as dice, sheets of paper, and small figurines, the role of materiality in analog literacies differs substantially from digital contexts. At the same time, exploring the cultural practices and talk that shaped play, the author emphasizes that analog gaming remains connected to the digital affordances of online texts, transmedia production, and tools for communication. By considering how seemingly archaic gaming practices recast literacies research around games and learning, the author argues for continued scrutiny of these playful domains.]

AB  - Mobile technology has been increasingly applied to educational settings in the past decade. Although researchers have attempted to investigate both students' and teachers' preferences regarding mobile learning, few studies have investigated the differences between the two, an understanding of which is important for developing effective mobile learning environments. To address this issue, a mobile learning environmental preference survey (MLEPS) consisting of eight factors, "ease of use," "continuity," "relevance," "adaptive content," "multiple sources," "timely guidance," "student negotiation" and "inquiry learning," was developed in this study. A total of 1239 students (609 males and 630 females) and 429 teachers (208 males and 221 females) who employed mobile technology to learn and teach in schools completed the questionnaire. From the structural equation models, it was found that the major difference between the preferences of teachers and students in learning with mobile technologies was that the teachers tended to focus more on the technical issues, while the students cared more about the richness and usefulness of the learning content. In addition, both the students and teachers considered that the "anytime" and "anywhere" support provided via the mobile technology played an important role during the learning activities, engaging them in searching for information, collecting data, interpreting data and summarizing findings. It is therefore suggested that learning environments which conform to both students' and teachers' preferences be developed in the future.

AB  - [The field of STEM education calls for a nuanced understanding of participation as participation measured by attendance provides limited information about student learning. This multiple case study contributes to a nuanced understanding of youth’s participation trajectories in a multimodal composition project. In the project, fifth to eighth grade students worked in small groups to create multimodal science fiction stories in which they needed to propose creative solutions to issues related to climate change. In this study, I adopted two theoretical perspectives, disciplinary identity development and community of practice, to analyze participation trajectories with multiple sources of data. This study shows that STEM practices mediated by multiple modes can not only offer students flexibility in moving across forms of participation, but also open space for them to demonstrate their expertise as knowledge producers. Furthermore, this study suggests that the following strategies could be effective for broadening participation in STEM practices: supporting the development of reflective understanding of connections between disciplines through digital literacies, providing exposure in composing with multiple modes, focusing on building a close relation between self and digital artifacts, and offering flexibility in moving across interactional spaces. These insights shed light on broadening participation in other multimodal learning settings.]

AB  - [Students search the Web frequently for many purposes, one of which is to search information for academic assignments. Given the huge amount of easily accessible online information, they are required to develop new reading skills and become more able to effectively evaluate the reliability of web sources. This study investigates the distribution of their visual attention while reading webpages using eyetracking methodology. The aim was to examine whether information received differential attention depending on the reliability of the source and whether the individual characteristics of topic-specific prior knowledge and epistemic beliefs moderated their visual behavior during reading. Factual knowledge after reading was also examined. Forty-nine university students read four webpages providing verbal and graphical information about the universal validity of the central dogma of molecular biology, which varied for reliability. Indices of first-pass and second-pass reading or inspection were used to trace the processing of information within each page. Findings revealed that readers made an implicit source evaluation as they spent a longer time inspecting the pictures about the more and less familiar information within the most reliable source during the immediate, more automatic, processing. In addition, topic-specific epistemic beliefs moderated this processing as readers with more availing convictions about knowledge attended more the information provided in pages that required more discernment. Moreover, readers increased their factual knowledge of the topic after reading. Educational implications are outlined.]

AB  - [When reading conflicting science-related texts, readers may attend to cues which allow them to assess plausibility. One such plausibility cue is the use of graphs in the texts, which are regarded as typical of 'hard science'. The goal of our study was to investigate the effects of the presence of graphs on the perceived plausibility and situation model strength for conflicting science-related texts, while including the influence of readers' amount of experience with scientific texts and graphs as a potential moderator of these effects. In an experiment mimicking web-based informal learning, 77 university students read texts on controversial scientific issues which were presented with either graphs or tables. Perceived plausibility and situation model strength for each text were assessed immediately after reading; reader variables were assessed several weeks prior to the experiment proper. The results suggest that graphs can indeed serve as plausibility cues and thus boost situation model strength for texts which contain them. This effect was mediated by the perceived plausibility of the information in the texts with graphs. However, whether readers use graphs as plausibility cues in texts with conflicting information seems to depend also on their amount of experience with scientific texts and graphs.]

AB  - Over the last several chapters, you’ve encountered several educational practices that contribute to the production and maintenance of inequality within schools. While sociologists do not generally think that educators intentionally produce disparities among students, they generally agree that these disparities result from practices like tracking and the disproportionate use of exclusionary discipline. University of Southern California sociologist Ann Owens reminds us that within-school inequalities are only part of the story.  As Owens makes clear, American schools have long been highly segregated by both race and socioeconomic status. School segregation has multiple sources. As Eschmann and Payne point out in chapter

TI  - Reading Scientifically: Practices Supporting Intertextual Reading Using Science Knowledge
AU  - Enfield, Mark
AB  - This paper reports on a study of teachers' actions when reading informational and narrative texts in the context of elementary science learning experiences.Focusing on the development of fundamental and derived senses of science literacy through the integrated science lessons, the research further explores the affordances of different genres of text in science learning. The findings highlight that teacher actions can support students engaging in inquiry provoked during reading events. However, this was not easy to do and required more than providing students with opportunities to discuss and share their questions. Furthermore, the study revealed that purposes for reading and the notion of making predictions were contextualized activities that impact the nature of students' engagement with texts. Based on these findings it is possible to make inferences that raise questions for future research. The construct of fundamental and derived senses of science literacy revealed that most of the actions of teachers focused on fundamental senses. Yet, there were moments of derived senses of science literacy that offer glimpses of the usefulness of this construct for supporting integrated learning. Thus the outcome is to consider this framework when developing integrated learning experiences in science.

AU  - Peabody, Seth

AB  - [If the German-speaking world is conceived of as a pluralistic society, open to migration, and integrated in global networks, then what could Heimat mean for German Studies? This article presents a rationale and curricular design model for critically unpacking the cultural narrative of Heimat within a globalized context. As numerous scholars have argued, Heimat is a complex, possibly untranslatable concept that expresses both belonging and exclusion. Its connection to nationalism, racism, and propaganda in German history is well known, and we argue that its most recent reemergence in public and political discourse presents pressing implications for German instruction. Given all of the cultural energies embedded into the concept, this article considers how we might reframe Heimat in our courses to build students’ critical thinking skills and global perspectives. Through recent curriculum reform efforts in our undergraduate German program, we have implemented an iterative approach to critically probing the layered meanings of Heimat via multiple texts and avenues for student engagement at each level of the curriculum. By engaging the concept through a spiraling, content-driven design, students confront the implications of Heimat as an organizer of German identities and a discursive vehicle for achieving a more inclusive Germany and German Studies.]

In studies conducted by us over the past several years, we have investigated the self-regulation strategies utilized by students in their writing, and the dynamic relationship between these and the students' achievement goals. For this purpose, we developed a unique research tool that examines the writing process of students and enables triangulation of data from multiple sources, based on stimulated recall combined with traces in the written product, observation, and interview (Kaplan, Lichtinger & Margulis, 2011). In this article, we describe the structure and application of this tool; review studies of different student populations with whom we employed it; and address the resulting theoretical and practical findings regarding the writing process.]

Data from multiple sources was collected from pre-service English teachers enrolled in a TESOL graduate program in Taiwan, including video-recordings of the participants’ presentations on their final SVVR projects and their self-generated VR teaching materials/artifacts, with two one-to-one semi-structured interviews further analyzed based on thematic analysis. The major findings demonstrate that through conducting the SVVR project, participants learned: (1) to compose multimodal lessons; (2) to concretize intangible contexts for learning; and (3) to use space as a mode for teaching and learning. The authors presented insights into affordance of SVVR material production for their multiliteracy development of engaging pre-service English teachers, as well as their perceptions with regard to this SVVR hands-on experience.

In this study, researchers taught poor readers with and without disabilities in eighth grade to generate main idea statements; create, compare, and contrast paragraphs; and identify cause and effect relations, along with relevant multisyllabic word study and vocabulary, as they read history text. The 34 participating students included 14 with disabilities and 20 without disabilities, who scored below the 5th percentile in reading, on average. The results were compared across special education and English learner status and with 81 typical readers from the same classes who studied the same units of history. Treated students made significant gains in use of these strategies, and poor readers with and without disabilities performed similar to their typical reader classmates in two of the three strategies following instruction. The instructional routines for each strategy are described.]

There were no differences in reading time across conditions for sentences targeted by the pre-reading questions. There were three main findings with respect to cued recall. First, participants in the experimental conditions did better on questions that had greater similarity to relevance instructions than questions that had lesser similarity to relevance instructions. Second, participants in the experimental conditions did better on questions that had greater similarity to relevance instructions than the participants in the other conditions on those same questions. Third, participants in the control condition recalled equal amounts of information for both question.

AB  - This study investigated how varying the lexical encodings of technical terms in multiple texts influences learners' dyadic processing of scientific-related information. Fifty-seven pairs of college students read journalistic texts on depression. Each partner in a dyad received one text; for half of the dyads the partner's text contained different lexical encodings of the same concepts; for the other half the lexical encodings and texts were identical. They then read a case report on first signs of depression. Communicating via a chat room, each dyad had to write a causal diagnosis and suggest a treatment. Results showed that dyads in the different-encoding condition explicitly elaborated the meaning of technical terms more often, produced more differentiated answers, and acquired more knowledge. It is concluded that deliberately switching different words for the same underlying content, and engaging students in discussion of that content, influences learners' discourse and promotes scientific/conceptual understanding.

AB  - Past research has shown that readers often fail to notice conflicts in text. In our present study we investigated whether accessing information from multiple documents instead of a single document might alleviate this problem by motivating readers to integrate information. We further tested whether this effect would be moderated by source expertise. One hundred undergraduates read the same medical information purportedly written by either medical experts or laypeople, which was presented as one document or spread across four documents. Results revealed partial support for our hypotheses. Readers of multiple documents exhibited superior memory for conflicts and provided a more balanced description of conflicting information in essays they wrote. Variation of author expertise moderated the effect of presentation format in the essay task but not on the memory test. The results extend previous research by showing that multiple documents reading also stimulates the integration of conflicting information.

AB  - [The ability to meaningfully and critically integrate multiple texts is vital for twenty-first-century literacy. The aim of this systematic literature review is to synthesize empirical studies in order to examine the current state of knowledge on how intertextual integration can be promoted in educational settings. We examined the disciplines in which integration instruction has been studied, the types of texts and tasks employed, the foci of integration instruction, the instructional practices used, integration measures, and instructional outcomes. The studies we found involved students from 5th grade to university, encompassed varied disciplines, and employed a wide range of task and text types. We identified a variety of instructional practices, such as collaborative discussions with multiple texts, explicit instruction of integration, modeling of integration, uses of graphic organizers, and summarization and annotation of single texts. Our review indicates that integration can be successfully taught, with medium to large effect sizes. Some research gaps include insufficient research with young students; inadequate consideration of new text types; limited attention to students' understandings of the value of integration, integration criteria, and text structures; and lack of research regarding how to promote students' motivation to engage in intertextual integration.]

Results showed that students explicitly and implicitly paid attention to sources of documents as well as sources cited within documents and that their attention to source information was associated with its use in evaluating, predicting, and interpreting the content of the documents. Students' sourcing activity varied across documents. The two documents that took the strongest, opposing stances on the controversy elicited the most sourcing. We also observed that, in essays they wrote on the controversy, students' spontaneous sourcing activity was related to their citation of a particularly trustworthy source. The study's theoretical implications are discussed in terms of the Documents Model framework.

AB  - A refutation text is designed to promote conceptual change by explicitly acknowledging commonly held misconceptions about a topic, directly refuting them, and providing an accurate explanation. In this study, we determined the impact of different types of refutation texts on adolescent readers' conceptual change learning in science. Specifically, we manipulated the way the correct conception was justified and explained following work in epistemic cognition. Three different types of justification were compared to a control condition: justification by authority, justification by multiple sources, and justification by personal opinion. The findings showed that learning effects were optimized when the correct conceptions were presented in terms of a corroborated consensus among multiple sources.

Statistical analyses highlighted the inconsistencies among readability formulae for Grades 2–6 levels of the standards. There was a lack of correlation among the readability measures, and also when comparing different text sources. Online texts were the most disparate with respect to text difficulty. These findings suggest implications for elementary teachers to support students who learn through reading online, science-based resources.

One-hundred fifty-four undergraduate students read two conflicting explanations concerning the relationship between blood type and personality under two conditions: either one explanation with a higher credibility source and the opposite explanation with a lower credibility source or the same two explanations but with the sources interchanged. Afterwards, students wrote their opinions about the controversial issue. In their opinion essays, students were more likely to resolve the conflicts between the two explanations by affirming the one from the higher credible source and/or negating the opposite one from the lower credible source, though source manipulation had a small and partial effect on intertextual conflict resolution compared with the perceived quality of each explanation and prior attitudes. However, students' attention to source information during reading and their use of the information for justifying their intertextual conflict resolution were limited. These results suggest that undergraduate students are capable of, but not good at, using source information for intertextual conflict resolution.]

TI  - Metacognitive Process in Online Text Construction

AB  - [ABSTRACT Many studies have reported the results of how students constructed texts, yet the cognitive process of how texts were constructed by sentences and how the constructive process was formulated and reformulated have rarely been addressed. This study aims to develop a computer-aided text construction system which supports 83 English as a Foreign Language (EFL) university students in inserting sentences to construct texts with the scaffoldings of lexical cohesion and sentence relations. The students' actions in text construction were recorded in a recording module which showed their metacognitive process during the task. Results of this study revealed that the engagement in metacognitive process was rarely found in the students who made little progress through three online texts. The students who demonstrated the developmental progress in three texts were actively engaged in the metacognitive process to monitor and evaluate their text constructive problems. They then frequently revised the text by reselecting the sentences with the assistance of lexical cohesion and sentence relations. It was further found that students' metacognition could be strengthened by the text construction task. The increased engagement in metacognition, especially reselecting the sentences (revising), led to higher scores being obtained in text construction.]

AB  - [The characteristics of the online environment alter how students and instructors interact. Scientific discourse among students and instructors in an online text-only synchronous environment was analyzed. In converting dialogue to text, many of the nonverbal cues, such as facial expression and tone of voice, which instructors use to gauge student understanding are lost. The participants adapt their communication style to the medium, and we present a new interaction pattern for student—instructor communication found prevalent in the synchronous, text-only, online environment. This study has implications for instructors who use synchronous, text-based communication for their courses, namely the value of posing additional questions from the instructor to verify student understanding.]

TI  - A Collective Case Study of Online Interaction Patterns in Text Revisions

AU  - Shan-Pi Wu
AB  - [ABSTRACT Learning happens through interaction with others. The purpose of this study is to investigate how online interaction patterns affect students' text revisions. As a sample, 25 undergraduate students were recruited to play multiple roles as writers, editors, and commentators in online text revisons. In playing different roles, they chose to read peer writers' texts, edit peer writers' errors, evaluate peer editors' suggestions and corrections, and finally rewrite their own texts. Students' choices of actions in the system to interact with their peers for the common goal of text improvement were identified as interaction patterns in this study. Results of this study revealed significant differences in students' interaction patterns and their final texts. The interaction pattern of students who made both local (grammatical corrections) and global (the development, organization, and style of texts) revisions was an extensive and reciprocal process. The interaction pattern of students who made only local revisions was almost a one-way process. Based on these interaction patterns, we suggest that teachers encourage low-participating students to engage in interactions with their peers by showing the benefits of peers' text revisions in the final drafts. Providing necessary assistance and guidance to low-participating students is essential, given their difficulties in writing texts, editing peer writers' texts, and evaluating peer editors' suggestions.]

AB  - Many professions require the processing of information from multiple sources and the making of rapid decisions under pressure. Making accurate decisions is especially crucial in high-stakes settings such as law enforcement, intelligence analysis, and medicine. Since high-stakes decisions often have grave consequences involving life and death situations, one would expect professionals in these fields to make unbiased decisions by considering all available information, treating evidence fairly, and rationally weighing all the relevant costs and benefits. Research has shown, however, that due to the rapid-response nature of these kinds of judgments, decision-makers often rely on heuristics, especially when in unfamiliar situations

TI  - Cognitive Conflicts and Resolutions in Online Text Revisions: Three Profiles
AU  - Yu-Fen Yang
AB  - [ABSTRACT This study investigates how college students solve their cognitive conflicts when receiving peers' suggestions and corrections in online text revision. A sample of 45 undergraduate students were recruited to read their peer writers' texts, edit peer writers' errors, evaluate peer editors' corrections and suggestions, and finally rewrite their own texts. Stratified sampling was employed to identify three profiles from students I, II, and III in representing participants' resolution process of assimilation, accommodation, and equilibrium respectively. Results of this study showed that student I seemed to be unaware of cognitive conflicts between her first draft (prior knowledge) and peer editors' corrections and suggestions (new information). She then directly duplicated peer editors' corrections into her final draft. This resulted in few differences between her first and final drafts in spite of some revisions in grammatical forms. In contrast, student II and III were aware of cognitive conflicts between their first drafts and peer editors' suggestions and corrections. They were actively engaged in the process of evaluation in making choices and decisions on accepting or rejecting peer editors' suggestions and corrections. They then revised their texts in local revision (grammatical corrections), global revision (corrections on the style, organization, or development of a text), and perspective revision (e.g. to view their own texts from readers' perspectives). This study suggests the importance of arousing students' language awareness of cognitive conflicts in the process of text revision by evaluating each correction and suggestion from peers.]

AB  - [In this study, we investigated the pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) that physics graduate teaching assistants (TAs) developed in the context of teaching a new introductory physics curriculum, Matter and Interactions (M&I). M&I is an innovative introductory physics course that emphasizes a unified framework for understanding the world and presents physics through a few fundamental principles rather than exposing students to concepts through a series of derived equations. Through a qualitative, multiple case study research design, data were collected from multiple sources: non-participant observations, digitally recorded video, semistructured interviews, TAs' written reflections, and researchers' field notes. The TAs' PCK included three components: (a) knowledge of M&I curriculum goals, (b) knowledge of instructional strategies appropriate to the M&I course, and (c) knowledge of students' learning. This study shows the complexity of adopting curriculum reforms and the necessity to support the faculty's and TAs' knowledge development when a novel science curriculum is adopted.]

AB  - [An observer's visual perception of the absolute distance between his or her position and an object is based on multiple sources of information that must be extracted during scene viewing. Research has not yet discovered the viewing duration observers need to fully extract distance information, particularly in navigable real-world environments. In a visually directed walking task, participants showed a sensitive response to distance when they were given 9-ms glimpses of floor-and eye-level targets. However, sensitivity to distance decreased markedly when targets were presented at eye level and angular size was rendered uninformative. Performance after brief viewing durations was characterized by underestimation of distance, unless the briefviewing trials were preceded by a block of extended-viewing trials. The results indicate that experience plays a role in the extraction of information during brief glimpses. Even without prior experience, the extraction of useful information is virtually immediate when the cues of angular size or angular declination are informative for the observer.]

A metaphor of driving, which likens reading to an everyday practice, demystifies complexities inherent in reading. Both reading and driving are active, strategic processes. Just as drivers deploy multifaceted driving processes to reach destinations on different types of roads in varied contexts and conditions, readers deploy multifaceted reading processes to reach reading goals with different types of texts in varied reading contexts and conditions. The DRIVE (Deploying Reading in Varied Environments) model provides a view of reading that is accessible and actionable while preserving complexity.]

AB  - [The authors report on a study of writing transfer using a relatively novel method. Specifically, they use screencast videos to study the work of a dozen undergraduates who had taken first-year writing and were now enrolled in an interdisciplinary biology class. The authors argue that students were able to adapt to the writing requirements in the biology class because they implicitly understood themselves to be engaged in Carter's metagenre of "research from sources." Because students in this study had been asked to engage in that metagenre at least since high school, they believed their writing habits were established well before first-year writing, and consequently they have trouble recognizing the influence of such a course on their subsequent work. The study also revealed that students coordinated multiple texts simultaneously in order to engage in processes akin to what Howard has called "patchwriting" but also similar to the habits of professional writers. Whereas professional writers have well established networks for seeking information, the students in this study worked in relative isolation, using a few sources found haphazardly through library or Google searches. The authors suggest that instructors spend more time helping students develop effective networks of information, including experts and organizations in addition to published sources.]

AB  - [ABSTRACT Science simulations are popular among educators as such simulations afford for multiple visual representation and interactivity. Despite the popularity and abundance on the internet, our literature review suggested little research has been conducted on the use of simulation in elementary school. Thus, an exploratory pilot case study was conducted to address this research gap. In this study, an open source energy simulation was remixed for use in elementary school targeted at the Grade 4 & 5 students as an after-school enrichment program. We proposed 3 stages: design, customization and implementation, to provide useful insights with the aim to allow other educators to conduct their own remixed simulation lessons. The simulation design principles (e.g., learning outcomes and colour coding) with the corresponding TPACK construct that emerged from the design and customization stages were reported. Such simulation design principles would be useful to interested educators and researchers who wish to adapt and use simulation or teach others how to remix simulation. Data from the multiple sources (e.g., field observations, surveys, design notes and existing simulations) indicated that students enjoyed learning with the remixed energy simulation.]

AB  - [ABSTRACT Young people now must compete in a global, knowledge-based, innovation-centered economy; they must acquire not just academic knowledge, but also character attributes such as intrinsic motivation, persistence, and flexibility. To accomplish these ambitious goals, the National Research Council (2012) of the United States recommends the use of “deeper learning” classroom strategies. These include case-based learning, multiple representations of knowledge, collaborative learning, apprenticeships, life-wide learning, learning for transfer, interdisciplinary studies, personalized learning, connected learning, and diagnostic assessments. Immersive media (virtual reality, multi-user virtual environments, mixed and augmented realities) have affordances that enhance this type of learning. EcoXPT is an inquiry-based middle school curriculum on ecosystem science that invites students into immersive experimentation with scaffolding tools that support deeper learning. This includes a case-based approach situated in an unfolding eutrophication scenario in which students learn new information from their observations over space and time, speaking with virtual characters in the world, and gathering information in the field guide and other sources. Diagnostic assessments of students’ progress are based on multiple sources, including process data from various types of logfiles. Multiple varied forms of representation convey perceptual, graphical, and experimental data, enabling students to investigate relationships between variables. Students are apprenticed in the ways of knowing of ecosystems scientists, which involves interdisciplinary knowledge. Students collaborate in teams of two, subdividing the tasks of gathering evidence.]

AB  - We are developing technology to translate acoustic characteristics of speech into visual cues that can be used to supplement speechreading when hearing is limited. Research and theory have established that perceivers are influenced by multiple sources of sensory and contextual information in spoken language processing. Previous research has also shown that additional sources of information can be learned and used to supplement those that are normally available but have been degraded by sensory impairment or difficult environments. We tested whether people can combine or integrate information from the face and information from newly learned cues in an optimal manner. Subjects first learned the visual cues and then were tested under three conditions. Words were presented with just the face, just the visual cues, or both together. Performance was much better with both cues than with either one alone. Similar to the description of previous results with audible and visible speech, the present results were well described by the Fuzzy Logical Model of Perception (Massaro, 1998), which predicts optimal or maximally efficient integration.
