AB  - We examine the effects of writing tasks on epistemic change in the context of an intervention which aims at modifying psychology students' epistemic beliefs (beliefs about the nature of knowledge and knowing). The intervention uses a multiple-texts approach. Participants first read multiple texts containing controversial evidence from 18 fictional studies on gender stereotyping. After reading, they are asked to write a balanced scientific essay explicitly focusing on the conditions under which boys respectively girls are discriminated against. We expected (1) that an intervention combining reading and writing has positive effects on epistemic beliefs, (2) that the beneficial effects of writing are reduced when the task instructions require writing a general overview or a one-sided argumentative text instead of a balanced essay, and (3) that reading and writing both uniquely contribute to epistemic change. Moreover, (4) we examined the effects of reading and writing on different levels of epistemic beliefs (topic-specific vs. domain-specific). Hypotheses were largely supported using data from two experimental and one correlational study (Study 1: N = 86; Study 2: N = 153; Study 3: N = 93). Implications of the results for research and practice are discussed.

AB  - Building on the multidimensional framework of epistemic cognition proposed by Greene et al. (Educational Psychologist 43:142-160, 2008), this study examined beliefs about justification of knowledge claims in science among 65 Norwegian 10th graders. The first research question asked whether beliefs in personal justification, justification by authority, and justification by multiple sources differed in strength among the participants. It was found that the students most strongly believed in justification by authority, followed by justification by multiple sources and personal justification. The second research question asked whether the three types of justification beliefs differentially and uniquely predicted the comprehension of multiple conflicting documents on a science issue. In a multiple regression analysis with multiple-documents comprehension indicated by essay performance as the dependent variable, both personal justification and justification by multiple sources emerged as unique predictors when topic knowledge was controlled for. Specifically, beliefs in personal opinion as a means of justifying knowledge claims in science was negatively related to multiple-documents comprehension, whereas beliefs in justification through corroboration across multiple sources of information were positively related to multiple-documents comprehension. This study provides new evidence about relationships between epistemic beliefs and new literacy competencies needed in an information society, such as integrating across multiple conflicting sources of information; relationships that may also have practical implications.

AB  - Tenth-graders responded to questionnaires assessing beliefs concerning the justification of knowledge claims in science and the certainty/simplicity of knowledge about a particular scientific issue. Students in an experimental group, who read multiple conflicting documents concerning the issue of sun exposure and health, changed their domain-specific beliefs concerning personal justification and justification by multiple sources as well as their topic-specific beliefs concerning the certainty/simplicity of knowledge, whereas no such changes were observed in a control group, reading multiple consistent documents on the same issue. Moreover, students in the experimental group outperformed students in the control group on a measure of multiple-documents comprehension. Findings are considered in light of the existing literature on the change of epistemic beliefs and multiple-documents comprehension. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - When individuals seek to learn about scientific information, they likely turn to the Internet. There, they will find multiple documents with conflicting points of view and varying degrees of accuracy. Integrating this information is challenging and may evoke epistemic emotions which may, in turn, influence how this information is integrated. Additionally, understanding complex scientific topics such as climate change requires causal reasoning. The current study investigated the role of emotions and prior knowledge in learning about the causes and effects of climate change from multiple texts. One hundred and twelve university students read either a congruent argument (two texts affirming the same point of view) or an incongruent argument (two texts with competing points of view). Text presentations were counterbalanced. Those who read congruent texts showed greater knowledge gains and were more likely to think causally than those in the incongruent group. Across all conditions, emotions tended to decrease in salience as participants read the second text, suggesting that individuals may become desensitized to the challenges of climate change with increased exposure to information. This suggests that caution must be taken to avoid promoting disengagement and inaction of individuals around controversial issues.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to test a hypothesized model that specified direct and indirect effects of textual and individual factors on readers' ability to integrate information about sources and content when reading multiple conflicting texts on a controversial socio-scientific issue. Using a path analytic approach with a sample of 140 Norwegian upper secondary school students, it was found that the textual factor of presentation format, specifically whether they read about the conflicting issue in multiple texts or in a single text, affected source-content integration directly as well as indirectly through memory for textual conflicts. Thus, compared to interacting with a single text, interacting with multiple texts improved students' sourcing performance directly as well as indirectly. Further, the individual factors of prior knowledge and gender affected source-content integration directly, with prior knowledge also having an indirect effect that was mediated by memory for textual conflicts. Specifically, students with higher prior knowledge and girls were likely to display better sourcing performance than were students with lower prior knowledge and boys, and prior knowledge also had an indirect positive effect on sourcing via memory for textual conflicts. Theoretical as well as educational implications of the findings are discussed.

AB  - In the present-day knowledge society, people need to critically comprehend information across multiple sources that express diverse and contradictory viewpoints. Due to the complexity associated with this process, an important role can be played by Executive Functions, that is, cognitive control processes used to regulate mental functioning and behavior when automatized elaborations are not sufficient. The aim of this article is to review existing research on the roles of executive functions when reading from multiple texts. To identify the appropriate studies, we conducted a search in the following databases: Web of science, Scopus, PsycInfo, Eric. The search string was created by combining the terms used in past literature reviews on executive functions and multiple-texts comprehension. From the total number of 4,877 records identified, seven articles met all the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Given the scarcity of studies on the topic, we decided to examine also eight articles reporting indirect evidence about the association between executive functions and multiple-text comprehension. Our review revealed that the study of the association between executive functions and multiple-texts comprehension is underdeveloped. The results seem to suggest that working memory is involved in surface comprehension, whereas results about sourcing and intertextual integration processes are mixed. Indirect evidence suggests that other executive functions, such as planning or monitoring, may be involved when learning from multiple texts. More research on this topic is needed given the increasing complexity of the contexts in which reading activities take place.

AB  - This study analyses the type of notes that students take when they read multiple documents. Thirty undergraduates read on a computer four scientific texts about the same topic in order to write an essay from two questions. Students were allowed to take notes and to use them to write the essay. Notes were categorised and quantified according to the degree of transformation of textual information, their relevance to the essay questions, amount of repetition, and level of integration. The effect and relationship of these variables with the quality of the essay were studied. Results showed that the objective of the task served to focus students' efforts as they took more relevant notes, but these tended to be verbatim rather than transformed notes. The text which is read first is used as base text of the note-taking process, and it is completed with information from the other texts, though, generally, students do not integrate information while they take notes. The quality of the essay is related to the quality of the notes. The need of improving the note-taking strategy in the context of multiple documents is discussed.

AB  - We test the hypothesis that the extent to which one obtains information on a given topic through Wikipedia depends on the language in which it is consulted. Controlling the size factor, we investigate this hypothesis for a number of 25 subject areas. Since Wikipedia is a central part of the web-based information landscape, this indicates a language-related, linguistic bias. The article therefore deals with the question of whether Wikipedia exhibits this kind of linguistic relativity or not. From the perspective of educational science, the article develops a computational model of the information landscape from which multiple texts are drawn as typical input of web-based reading. For this purpose, it develops a hybrid model of intra- and intertextual similarity of different parts of the information landscape and tests this model on the example of 35 languages and corresponding Wikipedias. In the way it measures the similarities of hypertexts, the article goes beyond existing approaches by examining their structural and semantic aspects intra- and intertextually. In this way it builds a bridge between reading research, educational science, Wikipedia research and computational linguistics.

AB  - Readers often comprehend belief-consistent information from multiple texts better compared with belief-inconsistent information (text-belief consistency effect). The aim of the present study was to investigate whether adolescents' comprehension of multiple texts is similarly impacted by their beliefs. Moreover, readers' prior knowledge and an alternating (compared with a blocked) mode of presenting multiple texts were expected to attenuate the text-belief consistency effect. High school students read two belief-consistent and two belief-inconsistent texts on one of two scientific issues in different modes of presentation (blocked vs. alternating). A recognition task was used to assess situation model strength for each text, and prior beliefs and prior knowledge were measured before the main experiment. As expected, in the blocked mode of presentation high school students had a stronger situation model for belief-consistent texts. In the alternating mode of presentation, participants had similar situation model strengths for the different texts. Moreover, high-knowledge participants experienced a text-belief consistency effect, whereas low-knowledge participants had weaker and similar situation models for the texts.

AB  - When reading multiple texts about controversial scientific issues, learners must construct a coherent mental representation of the issue based on conflicting information that can be more or less belief-consistent. The present experiment investigated the effects of textbelief consistency on the situation model and memory for text. Students read four texts about a scientific controversy. Learners' situation model was biased towards their beliefs when belief-consistent and belief-inconsistent texts were presented block-by-block. When the texts were presented alternatingly, situation models for belief-consistent and belief-inconsistent texts were equally strong. Moreover, the text base was better for belief-inconsistent texts. These results support the idea that prior beliefs influence the processing of conflicting information in multiple texts differently on the level of the situation model and on the propositional text base. A more balanced situation model of scientific controversies can be promoted by presenting belief-consistent and belief-inconsistent texts in an alternating sequence.

AB  - n A new generation of students should learn from e-materials on tablets, notebooks and smart phones. This consequently means that teachers must be competent to teach new literacies, needed for reading/learning from PDF texts, hypertexts and/or World Wide Web. The presented research investigated future teachers' metacognitive awareness in the process of reading online texts. The sample of 53 2nd year students at the university study program Elementary education and 28 students of natural science and mathematics, pedagogical study, was tested with the OSORS, method for measuring three types of online metacognitive awareness: general reading metacognition, problem-solving reading metacognition and support reading strategies. The results give an insight into future teachers' online metacognitive skills and guide toward conclusions concerning further investigation in the field of new literacies didactics.

AB  - Visualizations may help students understand the network of connections among multiple documents. This study explored how ninth-grade students used a novel digital document mapping scaffold to construct models of multiple documents. We examined students' maps and mapping processes in order to understand how they used the scaffold to visually represent multiple scientific documents on a controversial issue. We also investigated the relations between document mapping and argumentative writing in order to clarify how mapping might support written argumentation. Lastly, we explored how students perceived the purposes of document mapping. We found that students used the scaffold to construct several types of models that varied in their degree of source vs. content separation and integration. About half of the students constructed full documents models. Interleaving reading and mapping led to construction of more elaborate and well-integrated maps. Students who created more elaborate and two-sided maps also wrote essays that better integrated multiple documents in order to synthesize and weigh competing arguments. Students who revisited the maps and the documents while writing wrote essays that included and cited more documents. Students described document mapping as a tool for selecting and connecting sources and claims in order to support understanding and writing. These findings reveal how document mapping can support comprehension and integration of multiple documents. The findings also shed new light on how students construct documents models and on the relations between representations of multiple documents and argumentative writing. These results have implications for both theory and instruction.

AB  - Understanding conflicts between sources is an inherent part of science text comprehension. We examined whether readers' memories for conflicts and their situational interpretation of conflicts would be affected by reading goals and lexical cue phrases that signal rhetorical relationships. To this end, 198 undergraduates read multiple documents on a medical controversy either with signals or without, following one of three reading goals (argument, summary, keyword list). Readers' memories for conflicting information were measured with a conflict verification task, and their situational interpretation of conflicts was analyzed from written essays. Results reveal that both argument and summary tasks as well as signaling facilitated verification of conflicts. In their essays, however, summary goal readers reported conflicts more often in a one-sided fashion. In contrast, argument goal readers and those who read texts with signals reported conflicts in a balanced fashion that included source information. Both theoretical and practical implications of the findings for reading about controversial scientific issues are discussed.

AB  - Learners often have difficulties comprehending multiple texts about controversial scientific issues. In particular, learners with strong prior beliefs tend to construct a one-sided mental representation that is biased towards belief-consistent information (text-belief consistency effect). In the present study we examined the effectiveness of information of three metacognitive strategies tailored to strengthen the comprehension of belief-inconsistent information during multiple text comprehension. According to theories of self-regulated learning, knowledge about relevant metacognitive strategies improves comprehension only when learners are also motivated to use these strategies. These hypotheses were investigated in an experiment in which 85 participants read one belief-consistent and one belief-inconsistent text about a controversial scientific issue. Participants either received information about three metacognitive strategies or no additional information. In addition, participants' motivation was manipulated by providing them with either negative or positive performance feedback or no feedback. As predicted, a text-belief consistency effect was found, which was eliminated by strengthening the situation model for the belief-inconsistent text only when learners received information about relevant metacognitive strategies and were motivated to use these strategies after positive performance feedback.

AB  - This paper suggests that the purpose of humanities teaching within medical education should be primarily to teach and promote the informed, attentive, critical, and precise reading of the multiple texts that constitute medicine as a discursive field-in short, a poetics of medicine. This claim is illustrated by reconsidering Margaret Edson's play Wit, not as it is often used in medical education, as a cautionary tale about unprofessional behavior or as a way to inculcate "humanistic skills," but as an analysis of the relationships between texts and feelings-or cognition and emotion, or science and art. This reading is illustrated by comparing the poetics of Wit with those of two other texts representing ovarian cancer: a scientific paper in Oncology and a clinical case conference in JAMA.

AB  - In this article, we examine the mental processes and representations that are required of laypersons when learning about science issues from texts. We begin by defining scientific literacy as the ability to understand and critically evaluate scientific content in order to achieve one's goals. We then present 3 challenges of learning from science texts: the intrinsic complexity of science phenomena, the need to coordinate multiple documents of various types, and the rhetorical structure of the texts themselves. Because scientific information focuses on models, theories, explanations, and evidence, we focus on how explanatory and argumentative texts are processed. Then we examine 2 components of executive control in reading-goal-directed guidance and evaluation of content-that readers can acquire and adopt to deal with these challenges. Finally, we discuss 3 implications that these theories and empirical findings have for interventions intended to improve laypersons' understanding of scientific information.

AB  - Using cluster-analysis in a sample of 65 Norwegian 10th graders, we identified subgroups characterized by relatively high levels of knowledge combined with relatively low beliefs in personal justification of knowledge claims, as well as subgroups characterized by the opposite pattern of knowledge and personal justification. Moreover, the high knowledge/low personal justification groups differed with respect to the strengths of their beliefs in justification by authority and justification by multiple sources. After having read multiple conflicting texts on a science topic, the majority of students increased their knowledge about the topic and lowered their beliefs in personal justification, combining this pattern with higher beliefs in either justification by authority or justification by multiple sources. The subgroup characterized by relatively high level of knowledge and relatively low level of personal justification in combination with strong beliefs in justification by multiple sources performed best on a multiple-text comprehension measure. Theoretical and educational implications of the study are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The conventional approach to implementing extensive reading involves high initial investment costs, obtaining space and a circulation management system for the reading materials. Over time, texts become outdated, worn out or lost and need to be replaced. For teachers, using time in class for timed reading activities can be logistically complex: making copies, keeping time and adjusting for students who finish at different speeds. In order to alleviate these and additional concerns, we are developing PREMA, an extensive reading software package that allows online texts to be used as reading material. This original revolutionary software allows students to utilize texts of any size that they find online. PREMA (your Personal Reading Manager) is still under development, but comes with features for automatically tracking the total number of words read, measuring students' reading speed, and rating the relative difficulty of a particular text. There are additional features we are planning for the future, which will allow for customization for ESP uses. In our presentation, we will discuss the accomplishments, hopes and challenges PREMA faces as it continues to evolve into a distributable format. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Integrating information from across multiple sources is an important science literacy skill that involves the following: identifying intra- and intertextual ties, modeling relationships between sources and claims and making an evaluation of the claims made. Tasks that involve reading, interpreting and synthesizing multiple sources have been well explored particularly in the epistemic cognition literature. Interdisciplinarity is a growing area of interest in science education, in terms of the ways we induct students into interdisciplinary ways of thinking and working, including the synthesis of knowledge from across scientific disciplines. While interdisciplinary contexts frequently involve connecting multiple sources from different disciplines, how students complete these text-integration tasks has not been well investigated. This paper develops a model of interdisciplinary text integration for science literacy, drawing on dimensions of epistemic cognition. We exemplify the application of this approach in a specific case of environmental science graduate students, drawing on student syntheses to illustrate how our approach can be used to differentiate between students' written syntheses.

AB  - With the development of the Internet as a main source of information, teenagers are increasingly faced with multiple documents which may contain contradictory statements, and whose reliability must be assessed. One way to assess information reliability is to evaluate the source of the information (e.g., author expertise, intention). However, teenagers rarely engage in such a sourcing process. The present study aims to explore the role of a potential explanatory factor of teenagers' sourcing abilities: Advanced Theory of Mind (AToM). We hypothesized that AToM would be significantly related to teenagers' evaluation skills when reading multiple documents, and in particular to their attribution of sources' intentions and benevolence. We also hypothesized that this contribution will occur over and above teenagers' word reading and textual inferencing skills. Seventy-two students in Grade 8 read a set of online documents about a fictitious socio-scientific controversy and answered comprehension and evaluation questions. AToM was a significant predictor of comprehension and evaluation performance. The role of AToM was especially important for the source's evaluation and intentions questions. This study thus contributes to a better understanding of the possible factors of teenagers' developing sourcing skills.

AB  - Increased amounts of information available from the Internet have triggered new demands for students to evaluate information quality. Our study presents an instructional intervention aimed at fostering ninth grade students' critical evaluation of source reliability. The intervention was grounded into theories of multiple text comprehension and used an analytic framework that defines the core source dimensions of author position (competence), author motivation (intention), and media quality (pre-publication validation). Compared to controls, trained students 1) reduced the score assigned to links containing less reliable information in the three critical source dimensions (knowledge application task), as well as 2) increased the number of references made to a more reliable source (e.g., "scientific journal") and decreased references made to a less reliable source (e.g., "personal blog"), in a task presenting contradictory information across texts (transfer task). Nonetheless, the intervention outcomes varied according to the type of source evaluation question. We discuss the beneficial effects of implementing classroom intervention on sourcing skills as a means to improve teenagers' critical thinking when comprehending multiple documents.

AB  - Multiple text comprehension can greatly benefit from paying attention to sources and from using this information for evaluating text information. Previous research based on texts from the domain of history suggests that source-related strategies are acquired as part of the discipline expertise as opposed to the spontaneous use of these strategies by students just entering a field. In the present study, we compared the performance of students and scientists in the domain of psychology with regard to (a) their knowledge of publication types, (b) relevant source characteristics, (c) their use of sources for evaluating the credibility of multiple texts, and (d) their ability to judge the plausibility of argumentative statements in psychological texts. Participants worked on a battery of newly developed computerised tests with a think-aloud instruction to uncover strategies that scientists and students used when reading a text. Results showed that scientists scored higher in all of the assessed abilities and that these abilities were positively correlated with each other. Importantly, the superior performance of scientists in evaluating the credibility of multiple texts was mediated by their use of source information. Implications are discussed in terms of discipline expertise.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate how two female students participated in science practices as they worked in a multimedia case-based environment: interpreting simulated results, reading and writing multiple texts, role-playing, and Internet conferencing. Using discourse analysis, the following data were analyzed: students' published web posters, Internet conferencing logs between American and Zimbabwean university students, and a focus group interview. Three constructs supported the development of these students' identities in practice: (a) multimedia cases creating emotional involvement; (b) authoring web posters, and role-playing situated in cross-cultural social networks; and (c) altruism associated with relevant global topics. The investigators argue that educators and developers of online learning environments consider social contexts, authoring, and opportunities for cross-cultural interaction to support participation in science practices.

AB  - This study examined 57 learners' emotions (i.e., joy, anger, confusion, frustration) as they engaged with scientific content while learning about microbiology with Crystal Island, a game-based learning environment (GBLE). Measures of learners' prior knowledge, in-game text comprehension, facial expressions of emotion, and posttest reading comprehension were collected to examine the relationship between emotions and single- and multiple-text comprehension. Analyses found that both discrete and non-discrete emotions were expressed during reading and answering in-game assessments of single-text comprehension. Learners expressed greater joy during reading and greater expressions of anger, confusion, and frustration during in-game assessments. Further results found that learners who expressed a high number of different emotions throughout reading and completing in-game assessments tended to have lower in-game comprehension scores whereas a higher number of different expressed emotions while completing in-game assessments was associated with greater posttest comprehension. Finally, while increased prior knowledge was associated with higher single- and multiple-text comprehension, there was no interaction between prior knowledge and emotions on multiple-text comprehension. Overall, this study found that (1) learners often express more than one emotion during GBLE activities, (2) emotions expressed while learning with a GBLE shift across different activities, and (3) emotions are related to demonstrated comprehension, but the type of activity influences this relationship. Results from this study provide implications for how emotions can be examined as learners engage in GBLE activities as well as the design of GBLEs to support learners' emotions accounting for different activity demands to increase comprehension of single and multiple texts.

AB  - Scientists frequently construct explanatory models based on information they read about scientific phenomena. Modeling is a complex task involving reasoning about what information from multiple texts, including verbal and visual representations, is task-relevant and how it relates to the model. In this study, ninth graders were randomly assigned to a text-based modeling task with or without an instructional tool designed to support selection and elaborative processing of relevant information. Participants completed prompted self-explanation protocols during the modeling task and a learning task afterward. Participants with the instructional tool demonstrated better model construction and learning. Self-explanation analyses indicated more elaborative processing of relevant information for those with the tool. Elaboration of relevant information significantly mediated the instructional tool effect, indicating that it is not the tool, but the forms of processing that it encouraged, that underlies better model construction and learning. Implications for science literacy instruction are discussed.

AB  - Introduction: Books and papers are the most relevant source of theoretical knowledge for medical education. New technologies of artificial intelligence can be designed to assist in selected educational tasks, such as reading a corpus made up of multiple documents and extracting relevant information in a quantitative way. Methods: Thirty experts were selected transparently using an online public call on the website of the sponsor organization and on its social media. Six books edited or co-edited by members of this panel containing a general knowledge of breast cancer or specific surgical knowledge have been acquired. This collection was used by a team of computer scientists to train an artificial neural network based on a technique called Word2Vec. Results: The corpus of six books contained about 2.2 billion words for 300d vectors. A few tests were performed. We evaluated cosine similarity between different words. Discussion: This work represents an initial attempt to derive formal information from textual corpus. It can be used to perform an augmented reading of the corpus of knowledge available in books and papers as part of a discipline. This can generate new hypothesis and provide an actual estimate of their association within the expert opinions. Word embedding can also be a good tool when used in accruing narrative information from clinical notes, reports, etc., and produce prediction about outcomes. More work is expected in this promising field to generate "real-world evidence." (c) 2023 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - BackgroundPrevious research indicates that students lack sufficient online credibility evaluation skills. However, the results are fragmented and difficult to compare as they are based on different types of measures and indicators. Consequently, there is no clear understanding of the structure of credibility evaluation. ObjectivesThe present study sought to establish the structure of credibility evaluation of online texts among 265 sixth graders. MethodsStudents' credibility evaluation skills were measured with a task in which they read four online texts, two more credible (a popular science text and a newspaper article) and two less credible (a layperson's blog text and a commercial text). Students read one text at a time and evaluated the author's expertise, the author's benevolence and the quality of the evidence before ranking the texts according to credibility. Four competing measurement models of students' credibility evaluations were assessed. ResultsThe model termed the Genre-based Confirming-Questioning Model reflected the structure of credibility evaluation best. The results suggest that credibility evaluation reflects the source texts and requires two latent skills: confirming the more credible texts and questioning the less credible texts. These latent skills of credibility evaluation were positively associated with students' abilities to rank the texts according to credibility. ImplicationsThe study revealed that the structure of credibility evaluation might be more complex than previously conceptualized. Consequently, students would benefit from activities that ask them to carefully analyse different credibility aspects of more and less credible texts, as well as the connections between these aspects.

AB  - BackgroundThe cognitive incongruity model of epistemic beliefs and emotions states that if students' beliefs about the nature of knowledge (e.g., knowledge as simple and absolute) are incompatible with the epistemic nature of learning materials (e.g., complex and contradictory), cognitive incongruity arises. This, in turn, entails negative emotional consequences.
   AimsThe epistemic nature of contradictory learning materials might be perceived differently depending on whether individuals resolve the contradictions or not. Therefore, extending the cognitive incongruity model, the present paper argues that cognitive (in)congruity also depends on how individuals act on the learning materials. We expect that only if students resolve contradictory scientific claims (e.g., by identifying moderators), more advanced epistemic beliefs (e.g., evaluativism) have positive emotional effects and vice versa.
   SampleA field-experimental study with N=86 undergraduate psychology students was conducted.
   MethodUsing a multiple-texts approach, participants were first presented controversial evidence on gender stereotyping from 18 different (fictional) studies. In contrast to similar multiple-texts approaches, all contradictions could be resolved by identifying the contextual factors that a certain type of stereotype discrimination occurs in (resolvable controversies'). After reading, the experimental group was asked to resolve the contradictions, whereas two control groups read the same texts, but were not required to resolve the controversies.
   ResultsResults revealed that absolute beliefs positively and evaluativistic beliefs negatively predict negative emotions, but only if students were instructed to resolve the contradictions.
   ConclusionsOur results suggest that extending the cognitive incongruity model by how students deal with controversial learning materials might be worthwhile.

AB  - With an increasing focus on science and technology in education comes an awareness that students must be able to understand and integrate scientific explanations from multiple sources. As part of a larger project aimed at deepening our understanding of student processes for integrating multiple sources of information, we are developing machine learning and natural language processing techniques for evaluating students' argumentative essays. In previous work, we have focused on identifying conceptual elements of the essays. In this paper, we present a method for inferring the causal structure of student essays. We used a standard parser to derive grammatical dependencies of the essay and converted them to logic statements. Then a simple inference mechanism was used to identify concepts linked to syntactic connectors by these dependencies. The results suggest that we will soon be able to provide explicit feedback that enables teachers and students to improve comprehension.

TI  - The Trusted Server: A secure computational environment for privacy compliant evaluations on plain personal data
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - A growing framework of legal and ethical requirements limit scientific and commercial evaluation of personal data. Typically, pseudonymization, encryption, or methods of distributed computing try to protect individual privacy. However, computational infrastructures still depend on human system administrators. This introduces severe security risks and has strong impact on privacy: system administrators have unlimited access to the computers that they manage including encryption keys and pseudonymization-tables. Distributed computing and data obfuscation technologies reduce but do not eliminate the risk of privacy leakage by administrators. They produce higher implementation effort and possible data quality degradation. This paper proposes the Trusted Server as an alternative approach that provides a sealed and inaccessible computational environment in a cryptographically strict sense. During operation or by direct physical access to storage media, data stored and processed inside the Trusted Server can by no means be read, manipulated or leaked, other than by brute-force. Thus, secure and privacy-compliant data processing or evaluation of plain person-related data becomes possible even from multiple sources, which want their data kept mutually secret.

AB  - Research has shown that laypeople tend to rely on their own evaluations when encountering scientific text information that is easy to comprehend. This easiness effect of science popularization leaves them vulnerable to uncritically accepting misinformation presented in a simplified manner. The present study investigated whether warnings of misinformation frequently used in social networks and other online services mitigate or even prevent the persuasive advantage of information easiness. Forty-one medical laypeople read brief argumentative online texts proposing fictitious health claims. Texts were either easy or difficult to comprehend, and they either were or were not labeled with a warning that independent fact-checkers dispute the information. Results showed that warnings effectively increased laypeople's skepticism toward scientific misinformation. However, findings also suggested that warnings do not reduce the persuasive advantage of misinformation presented in an easily understandable manner, pointing to the limits of this communicative tool.

AB  - This article reports on two experiments where undergraduates read five documents on a scientific topic and afterwards answered comprehension questions and wrote either summaries or argument essays on the topic. In the first experiment, students who were instructed to work with the documents for the purpose of summarizing their contents displayed better comprehension and integration of document contents than did students instructed to construct arguments from the documents. In the second experiment, focusing on whether the effects of task instructions on multiple-documents comprehension and integration could be moderated by students' prior knowledge, it was found that only students with high prior knowledge were able to take advantage of instructions to construct arguments while reading, whereas low-knowledge readers seemed to be more hindered than helped by such task instructions. Theoretical as well as educational Implications of these findings are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - More than 50 000 papers have been published about COVID-19 since the beginning of 2020 and several hundred new papers continue to be published every day. This incredible rate of scientific productivity leads to information overload, making it difficult for researchers, clinicians and public health officials to keep up with the latest findings. Automated text mining techniques for searching, reading and summarizing papers are helpful for addressing information overload. In this review, we describe the many resources that have been introduced to support text mining applications over the COVID-19 literature; specifically, we discuss the corpora, modeling resources, systems and shared tasks that have been introduced for COVID-19. We compile a list of 39 systems that provide functionality such as search, discovery, visualization and summarization over the COVID-19 literature. For each system, we provide a qualitative description and assessment of the system's performance, unique data or user interface features and modeling decisions. Many systems focus on search and discovery, though several systems provide novel features, such as the ability to summarize findings over multiple documents or linking between scientific articles and clinical trials. We also describe the public corpora, models and shared tasks that have been introduced to help reduce repeated effort among community members; some of these resources (especially shared tasks) can provide a basis for comparing the performance of different systems. Finally, we summarize promising results and open challenges for text mining the COVID-19 literature.

AB  - Learning to read-amazing as it is to small children and their parents-is one thing. Reading to learn, explains Susan Goldman of the University of Illinois at Chicago, is quite another. Are today's students able to use reading and writing to acquire knowledge, solve problems, and make decisions in academic, personal, and professional arenas? Do they have the literacy skills necessary to meet the demands of the twenty-first century? To answer these questions, Goldman describes the increasingly complex comprehension, reasoning skills, and knowledge that students need as they progress through school and surveys what researchers and educators know about how to teach those skills.
   Successfully reading to learn requires the ability to analyze, synthesize, and evaluate information front multiple sources, Goldman writes. Effective readers must be able to apply different knowledge, reading, and reasoning processes to different types of content, from fiction to history and science, to news accounts and user manuals. They must assess sources of information for relevance, reliability, impartiality, and completeness. And they must connect information across multiple sources. In short, successful readers must not only use general reading skills but also pay close attention to discipline-specific processes.
   Goldman reviews the evidence on three different instructional approaches to reading to learn: general comprehension strategies, classroom discussion, and disciplinary content instruction. She argues that building the literacy skills necessary for U.S. students to read comprehensively and critically, and to learn content in a variety of disciplines should be a primary responsibility for all of the nation's teachers. But outside of English, few subject-area teachers are aware of the need to teach subject-area reading comprehension skills, nor have they had opportunities to learn them themselves. Building the capacity of all teachers to meet the literacy needs of today's students requires long-term investment and commitment from the education community as well as society as a whole.

AB  - This study investigated how varying the lexical encodings of technical terms in multiple texts influences learners' dyadic processing of scientific-related information. Fifty-seven pairs of college students read journalistic texts on depression. Each partner in a dyad received one text; for half of the dyads the partner's text contained different lexical encodings of the same concepts; for the other half the lexical encodings and texts were identical. They then read a case report on first signs of depression. Communicating via a chat room, each dyad had to write a causal diagnosis and suggest a treatment. Results showed that dyads in the different-encoding condition explicitly elaborated the meaning of technical terms more often, produced more differentiated answers, and acquired more knowledge. It is concluded that deliberately switching different words for the same underlying content, and engaging students in discussion of that content, influences learners' discourse and promotes scientific/conceptual understanding.

AB  - The movement of many human interactions to the internet has led to massive volumes of text that contain high-value information about individual choices pertaining to risk and uncertainty. But unlocking these texts' scientific value is challenging because online texts use slang and obfuscation, particularly so in areas of illicit behavior. Utilizing state-of-the-art techniques, we extract a range of variables from more than 30 million online ads for real-world sex over four years, data significantly larger than that previously developed. We establish prices in a common numeraire and study the correlates of pricing, focusing on risk. We show that there is a 15-19% price premium for services performed at a location of the buyer's choosing (outcall). Examining how this premium varies across cities and service venues (i.e. incall vs. outcall) we show that most of the variation in prices is likely driven by supply-side decision making. We decompose the price premium into travel costs (75%) and the remainder that is strongly correlated with local violent crime risk. Finally, we show that sex workers demand compensating differentials for the risk that are on par with the very riskiest legal jobs; an hour spent with clients is valued at roughly $151 for incall services compared to an implied travel cost of $36/hour. These results show that offered prices in the online market for real-world sex are driven by the kinds of rational decision-making common to most pricing decisions and demonstrate the value of applying machine reading technologies to complex online text corpora.

AB  - Complex changes have buffeted the discipline of literature during the past decades, calling on us to rethink its academic and cultural definitions, boundaries, and territories. Texts which until recently have not been examined within literary studies (such as films, online texts, and visual artifacts) have "invaded" the disciplinary borders, while literary texts have "leaked" into other disciplines, such as history, sociology, political science, and medicine. Moreover, in the academic field of literature, two opposing camps are currently competing. Onone side, researchers delve into aestheticstructural analyses of literary texts, and on the other, scholars examine literature as reflection of cultural and ideological power relations. With these academic processes at hand one wonders what becomes of literature as a set of texts and as an academic domain. Is it principally a research methodology-a way of observing, reading collecting, organizing, and interpreting information on reality? Or is it an object in itself? The article addresses this unresolved tension, outlining several new ways to manage this cultural and academic unclarity.

AB  - The current information society requires people to handle information from different sources, which entails specific skills beyond those needed to comprehend and use information from a single text. Given the relevance of becoming a competent reader in functional reading scenarios, it is crucial to examine how contextual-, task-, and individual-related factors may influence multiple-documents question-answering activities, a key issue for assessment and instruction. In this study, we examined the influence of text availability and question type in students' question-answering performance and the moderator effect of students' reading skill. Seventy secondary school students read three expository texts about a history topic. Next, they performed a concurrent question-answering task consisting of a set of intra- and intertext questions they answered either with or without the texts available. Finally, participants performed a free-recall task after a 24-hour delay without access to the learning materials. Results showed higher performance scores in the intratext questions when the text was available than when it was not. However, the superiority of text availability disappeared in the delayed recall task. Additionally, skilled readers who had the texts available scored higher in the concurrent question-answering task and, moreover, recalled more ideas in the recall task. These findings shed light on how contextual- (i.e., text availability), task- (i.e., question type), and student-related (i.e., reading skill) factors may influence both adolescents' question answering from multiple documents and their recall. The implications of these findings for the science of reading and the educational practice are discussed.

AB  - The advent of Big Data has seen both the sources and volumes of data increase rapidly. A multi-source information system can be used to represent information drawn from multiple sources. However, some of these sources are of less importance than others, and some are essentially worthless. Selecting the most valuable sources and efficiently fusing information are therefore core issues in the field of data science. To investigate this matter, we first propose internal-confidence and external-confidence degrees to estimate the reliability of each information source within a multi-source information system. A source selection principle is then constructed, allowing worthy and reliable information sources to be chosen. Furthermore, a new information fusion method is constructed by transforming the original information of each object into a triangular fuzzy information granule, and some uncertainty measures of this fusion process are studied. Finally, to interpret and comprehend the proposed theories and algorithm, extensive experiments are performed on six datasets to verify that our approach can deal with practical issues. The results indicate that the proposed triangular fuzzy granule fusion approach is efficient and effective for information fusion in multi-source datasets. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Starting from the Coudry's ([1986] 1988) of standard tests, I present a reflection on the scientific discourse from different publications (scientific articles, online texts from associations and organizations related to pathologies and also texts published in scientific events webpages and conferences) on the Fragile X Syndrome, to analyze how this pathology is described by the medical field, especially when it comes to language development and to the effects of power/knowledge (FOUCAULT, 2001) produced by this discourse and its implications. To counteract the deterministic discourse of the medical field, I present some data about the process of speech, reading and writing acquisition/use of one subject with the syndrome accompanied longitudinally highlighting - based on the assumptions of Discursive Neurolinguistics - his linguistic-cognitive work and the marks of his subjectivity in language. I attempt to identify these subject's language difficulties in order to point out what may be pathological, what is part of a normal speech, reading and writing acquisition/use and what may be related to other factors, which may be of a social order or related to the subject's life history.

AB  - In this study, we generated and tested a hypothesized model that specified direct and indirect linkages between different types of beliefs concerning the justification for knowing in science, motivation for science reading comprehension, and science achievement. Using a path analysis approach with a sample of 122 lower-secondary school students, results indicated that students' science reading comprehension self-efficacy predicted their achievement, with the justification belief variables indirectly affecting science achievement through their influence on science reading self-efficacy. Specifically, there was a negative indirect effect of personal justification on science achievement mediated by science reading comprehension self-efficacy, whereas both justification by authority and justification by multiple sources had positive indirect effects on science achievement mediated by self-efficacy. Beliefs in personal justification and justification by multiple sources affected achievement directly as well as indirectly. Both theoretical and educational implications of the results are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Increasingly, research and management in natural resource science rely on very large datasets compiled from multiple sources. While it is generally good to have more data, utilizing large, complex datasets has introduced challenges in data sharing, especially for collaborating researchers in disparate locations ("distributed research teams"). We surveyed natural resource scientists about common data-sharing problems. The major issues identified by our survey respondents (n = 118) when providing data were lack of clarity in the data request (including format of data requested). When receiving data, survey respondents reported various insufficiencies in documentation describing the data (e.g., no data collection description/no protocol, data aggregated, or summarized without explanation). Since metadata, or "information about the data," is a central obstacle in efficient data handling, we suggest documenting metadata through data dictionaries, protocols, read-me files, explicit null value documentation, and process metadata as essential to any large-scale research program. We advocate for all researchers, but especially those involved in distributed teams to alleviate these problems with the use of several readily available communication strategies including the use of organizational charts to define roles, data flow diagrams to outline procedures and timelines, and data update cycles to guide data-handling expectations. In particular, we argue that distributed research teams magnify data-sharing challenges making data management training even more crucial for natural resource scientists. If natural resource scientists fail to overcome communication and metadata documentation issues, then negative data-sharing experiences will likely continue to undermine the success of many large-scale collaborative projects.

AB  - Introduction: Domestic violence against women, also called gender-based violence, is the result of the imbalance of power in relationships, where men assume the role of dominator and women assume the role of the victim. However, for power relations to exist, the possibility of resistance and the desire to fight must coexist, even if it is only in the mind of the woman being victim of violence. In this regard, the trend of scientific studies on power relations present in domestic violence against women was explored. Materials and methods: A qualitative descriptive exploratory research was carried out through a systematic literature review. Online texts published between 2013 and November 2017 using the terms "domestic violence against women" and "power relations" were searched. Results: Seven scientific articles were found and completely read, which were subjected to content analysis. The following three analytical categories were created: "social markers contributing to the emergence of DVAW", "identity construction of women suffering from domestic violence", "consequences of domestic violence on women's health and professional practice". Discussion: The frequency of the topics addressed in the publications was adopted as a criterion for the analysis. A category was developed for each topic. Conclusions: Knowledge about power relations in domestic violence against women is minimal, which reveals that power in relationships is little studied and that more studies are needed for this purpose.

AB  - The academic and scientific research requirements that university demands, requires students to manage, analyze and integrate information from multiple sources, to build knowledge significantly. Thus, academic reading practices play a key role in the development of learning and discipline knowledge. Current studies in this field have found that the level of reading comprehension is related to the type of strategies involved in the management of written information. Therefore, self-regulated learning strategies from academic texts are essential to enable a more thoughtful and committed approach to reading, contributing to greater learning. The purpose of this paper is to analyze some personal aspects that promote self-regulated learning in academic texts understanding in college students, such as prior knowlegde and academic goals. 364 college students participated (69.5% men and 30.5% women) in their first semester of Engineering, with a mean age of 19.77 (SD=1.20). Through regression analysis it was found that prior knowledge and academic learning goals favor self-regulated learning strategies in understanding academic texts. These findings might guide the teaching practice to promote learning goal orientation and a skalfolding for the use of self-regulation strategies for meaningful learning in higher education students.

AB  - We explored readers' judgments of text relevance and strategy use while they read about a controversial scientific issue in multiple conflicting documents using a think-aloud methodology and had them write a short essay after reading. Participants were university-level students. There were three main findings. First, readers discriminated between more- and less-relevant information while they read. Second, the frequency with which they used strategies differed while they read more- and less-relevant information. Specifically, while they read more-relevant information, students were more likely to build connections between that information and information in other texts. Third, their judgments of more-relevant segments as relevant and their evaluation of less-relevant information while they read were related to the quality of students' essays after they read. We discuss how the findings may contribute to the literature on task-oriented reading of multiple documents.

AB  - Previous research has identified various factors that contribute to readers' comprehension of expository texts, including strategy expertise, language proficiency, prior knowledge, and more recently, readers' beliefs about knowledge. This study addresses the need to understand the relative contributions of these predictors to readers' comprehension of multiple texts and the processes used by readers to make sense of texts. Eighty-three students (grades 5-7) participated in this mixed-methods study. The sample consisted of monolingual students and emergent and proficient bilingual students who completed measures of expository comprehension, strategic knowledge and awareness, English-language proficiency, prior content knowledge, and epistemic beliefs. Ten bilingual students from this sample also completed a think-aloud protocol to allow for close examination of their meaning-making processes. In a multiple regression analysis, English-language proficiency was the strongest predictor of comprehension, followed by content knowledge. Strategy knowledge and awareness and epistemic beliefs were not related to multiple-text comprehension in the model. The relationship between English-language proficiency and comprehension was stronger for bilingual students than for monolingual students. Students in the think-aloud sample demonstrated emergent knowledge of processes of disciplinary reading of multiple texts, including metacognitive monitoring, theorizing authorial identity, and intertextual integration, while also displaying a tendency to defer to institutionalized authority when evaluating credibility of the texts. The findings provide directions for future research on the way young adolescents comprehend and learn from expository texts in the discipline of science.
   Spanish Estudios previos han identificado varios factores que contribuyen a la comprension de textos expositivos, los cuales incluyen la pericia estrategica, la competencia linguistica, el conocimiento previo, y recientemente, las creencias de los lectores sobre el conocimiento. Este estudio se enfoca en la necesidad de entender las contribuciones relativas de estos predictores a la comprension de los lectores de multiples textos y los procesos usados por los lectores para elaborar el sentido de los textos. Ochenta y tres estudiantes (grados 5-7) participaron en este estudio de metodos surtidos. La muestra consistio de estudiantes monolingues y estudiantes bilingues emergentes y habiles quienes completaron medidas de comprension expositiva, conciencia estrategica y conocimiento estrategico, habilidad linguistica del ingles, conocimiento previo del contenido, y creencias epistemicas. Diez estudiantes bilingues de esta muestra tambien completaron un protocolo en voz alta para poder examinar de cerca sus procesos de la elaboracion de sentido. En un analisis de regresion multiple, la habilidad linguistica del ingles fue el predictor mas importante de la comprension, seguida por el conocimiento del contenido. La conciencia estrategica, el conocimiento estrategico y las creencias epistemicas no mostraron tener relacion a la comprension de multiples textos en este modelo. La relacion entre la comprension y la habilidad linguistica del ingles fue mas importante en los estudiantes bilingues que en los estudiantes monolingues. Los estudiantes en la muestra de pensar en voz alta demostraron conocimiento emergente de los procesos de la lectura disciplinaria de multiples textos, incluyendo el control metacognitivo, el teorizar sobre la identidad del autor, y la integracion intertextual al mismo tiempo que mostraron una tendencia a deferir a la autoridad institucional al evaluar la credibilidad de los textos. Las conclusiones ofrecen orientacion para estudios futuros sobre la forma en que adolescentes jovenes comprenden y aprenden de textos expositivos en las disciplinas de las ciencias
   French Les recherches existantes ont identifie differents facteurs qui contribuent a la comprehension par les lecteurs des textes declaratifs, notamment l'expertise strategique, l'aisance linguistique, les connaissances anterieures et, plus recemment, leurs conceptions de la connaissance. Cette recherche repond au besoin de savoir quelle est la contribution relative de ces predicteurs a la comprehension qu'ont les lecteurs de differents textes et les processus qu'ils utilisent pour les comprendre. Quatre-vingt-trois eleves (classes de 5(e), 6(e), et 7(e) annee) ont participe a une etude comportant pluri methodologique. L'echantillon etait compose d'eleves unilingues, de bons eleves bilingues et d'eleves emergents afin d'obtenir des evaluations sur la comprehension de textes declaratifs, les connaissances, la conscience des strategies, la maitrise de l'anglais, la connaissance du contexte anterieur, et les conceptions epistemiques. Dix de ces eleves ont aussi passe un protocole de pensee a voix haute en vue d'une analyse plus complete de la facon dont ils procedent pour donner du sens. Dans une analyse de regression multiple, l'anglais apparait comme le plus fort predicteur de la comprehension, suivi de la connaissance du contexte. Les connaissances et la conscience des strategies ainsi que les conceptions epistemiques ne sont pas correlees avec la comprehension des differents textes dans le modele. Les relations entre la maitrise de l'anglais et la comprehension est plus forte chez les eleves bilingues que chez les monolingues. Les eleves de l'echantillon de l'epreuve de pensee a voix haute presentent une connaissance emergente des processus de lecture des textes en fonction de la discipline, y compris un pilotage metacognitif, une theorisation de l'identite de l'auteur, une integration intertextuelle, ainsi qu'une tendance a se referer a l'autorite institutionnelle lors de l'evaluation de la credibilite des textes. Ces resultats donnent des directions pour de futures recherches sur la facon dont les jeunes adolescents comprennent et font des apprentissages a partir de textes declaratifs dans le domaine scientifique.

AB  - Success in today's knowledge society requires the use of multiple sources of information to accomplish personal and professional goals. However, little is known about how young adolescents select, analyze, and synthesize multiple sources to address inquiry tasks. Using evidence-centered design we have constructed and tested web-based assessment activities for the selection of useful sources and for the analysis and synthesis of information across text sets. The activities are contextualized in science or history inquiry topics. The assessment activities are designed to provide formative information about student performance that can be used to plan instruction. The design process and the analyses of student performance on these activities are highlighting the unique challenges and opportunities of multiple source comprehension situations.

AB  - This qualitative case study explored the extent to which learners' L2 writing concepts changed across different collaborative writing tasks, and how languaging helped learners make meaning between scientific and spontaneous concepts. Four first-year MA students from a Chinese university formed a study group and engaged in collaborative writing tasks as required by an Academic English Reading and Writing course. Multiple sources of data were collected, including audio-taped group discussions, group writings, individual reflections, and course-related documents. Data analysis demonstrated the microgenetic evolving trajectories of the rhetorical modes of "maintaining the flow of information". The participants progressed from spontaneous knowledge of those concepts to a scientific system through languaging about a text containing these conceptual features. Learners' conscious usage of scientific terms, constant revisiting to their prior knowledge, and critical reading of the academic text highlight the mediating role of languaging in empowering the dynamic interaction between scientific reasoning and spontaneous thinking. This study suggests that the integration of stylistic analysis tasks, peer collaboration, and rhetorical concepts may facilitate the transformation of students' thinking patterns as well as the development of their L2 academic literacies.

AB  - How to deal with students' academic heterogeneity in the classroom is not only an important question from the perspective of pedagogical professional knowledge, but it is also part of a discourse between science, politics, society, and educational practice. As student teachers actively participate in these discourses, both productively and receptively, they need the general ability to adequately evaluate statements that derive from different sources of information. Based on the Multiple-Document-Comprehension model (MDC), it is examined whether undergraduate student teachers (n = 193) at the Paris Lodron University of Salzburg master the cognitive procedures that were derived from the MDC model. The student teachers were given a scientific text and a journalistic commentary on the question of how to deal with academic heterogeneity. Based on these texts, verification items had to be processed. Subsequently, the cognitive procedures were statistically modelled by using a Cognitive Diagnosis Model (CDM) in order to examine empirically the MDC model's multi-dimensionality. The results show that approx. 93% of the student teachers have not mastered at least one of the four MDC-related cognitive procedures. Thus, the study offers new possibilities in the diagnosis of skills for the comparison of multiple documents according to the MDC model in the field of teacher education research. Implications of this study can also be used for the training of prospective student teachers.

AB  - Background: Studies have shown that students' knowledge of osmosis and diffusion and the concepts associated with these processes is often inaccurate. This is important to address, as these concepts not only provide the foundation for more advanced topics in biology and chemistry, but are also threaded throughout both state and national science standards.
   Purpose: In this study, designed to determine the completeness and accuracy of three specific students' knowledge of molecule movement, concentration gradients, and equilibrium, I sought to address the following question: Using multiple evaluative methods, how can students' knowledge of molecule movement, concentration gradients, and equilibrium be characterized?
   Sample: This study focuses on data gathered from three students - Emma, Henry, and Riley - all of whom were gifted/honors ninth-grade biology students at a suburban high school in the southeast United States.
   Design and Methods: Using various qualitative data analysis techniques, I analyzed multiple sources of data from the three students, including multiple-choice test results, written free-response answers, think-aloud interview responses, and student drawings.
   Results: Results of the analysis showed that students maintained misconceptions about molecule movement, concentration gradients, and equilibrium. The conceptual knowledge students demonstrated differed depending on the assessment method, with the most distinct differences appearing on the multiple-choice versus the free-response questions, and in verbal versus written formats.
   Conclusions: Multiple levels of assessment may be required to obtain an accurate picture of content knowledge, as free-response and illustrative tasks made it difficult for students to conceal any misconceptions. Using a variety of assessment methods within a section of the curriculum can arguably help to provide a deeper understanding of student knowledge and learning, as well as illuminate misconceptions that may have remained unknown if only one assessment method was used. Furthermore, beyond simply evaluating past learning, multiple assessment methods may aid in student comprehension of key concepts.

AB  - Prior beliefs often bias the comprehension of multiple science-related texts such that belief-consistent texts are better comprehended compared to belief-inconsistent texts (text-belief consistency effect). Two experiments were conducted to investigate whether a metacognitive strategy training focusing on belief-biasing validation processes can reduce the text-belief consistency effect in multiple text comprehension. Participants in the control condition received the PQ4R training as a well-situated and effective reading skill training that increases receptive elaborative processing. In Experiment 1 (n = 39) and Experiment 2 (n = 53) participants receiving a metacognitive strategy training achieved a similar level of comprehension of belief-consistent and belief inconsistent texts, whereas a text-belief consistency effect was found in the PQ4R condition. These results indicate that a training focusing on belief-biasing validation processes prepare readers for the challenges to comprehend belief-relevant multiple texts, whereas strategies that foster receptive processing of information are not sufficient in the context of controversially discussed topics.

AB  - This study used think-aloud methodology to explore the strategic processing of 51 Norwegian undergraduates reading about an unfamiliar scientific issue in multiple conflicting documents presented in a Google-like environment. After reading, participants rated the trustworthiness of the sources and wrote essays on the issue. Findings indicated that students displayed reading behaviors falling in the main categories of identifying and learning important information, monitoring, and evaluating, with behaviors in all three categories involving the linking of information across different documents. Moreover, students' strategic processing while reading the documents was related to their evaluation of the trustworthiness of the sources and their inclusion of source citations in their essays. Specifically, more use of evaluation strategies was associated with less trust in biased and more trust in unbiased sources, and more use of evaluation strategies as well as cross-document linking strategies was associated with more explicit source citations and connections between sources and contents in the essays. Finally, students' strategic processing during reading was related to their written argumentation, with evaluating, monitoring, and cross-document linking positively related to argumentative reasoning about the scientific issue. We discuss how the findings may contribute to current theory on multiple-documents literacy and provide directions for further research in the area. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The WikiHyperGlossary is an information literacy technology that was created to enhance reading comprehension of documents by connecting them to socially generated multimedia definitions as well as semantically relevant data. The WikiHyperGlossary enhances reading comprehension by using the lexicon of a discipline to generate dynamic links in a document to external resources that can provide implicit information the document did not explicitly provide. Currently, the most common method to acquire additional information when reading a document is to access a search engine and browse the web. This may lead to skimming of multiple documents with the novice actually never returning to the original document of interest. The WikiHyperGlossary automatically brings information to the user within the current document they are reading, enhancing the potential for deeper document understanding.
   Results: The WikiHyperGlossary allows users to submit a web URL or text to be processed against a chosen lexicon, returning the document with tagged terms. The selection of a tagged term results in the appearance of the WikiHyperGlossary Portlet containing a definition, and depending on the type of word, tabs to additional information and resources. Current types of content include multimedia enhanced definitions, ChemSpider query results, 3D molecular structures, and 2D editable structures connected to ChemSpider queries. Existing glossaries can be bulk uploaded, locked for editing and associated with multiple social generated definitions.
   Conclusion: The WikiHyperGlossary leverages both social and semantic web technologies to bring relevant information to a document. This can not only aid reading comprehension, but increases the users' ability to obtain additional information within the document. We have demonstrated a molecular editor enabled knowledge framework that can result in a semantic web inductive reasoning process, and integration of the WikiHyperGlossary into other software technologies, like the Jikitou Biomedical Question and Answer system. Although this work was developed in the chemical sciences and took advantage of open science resources and initiatives, the technology is extensible to other knowledge domains. Through the DeepLit (Deeper Literacy: Connecting Documents to Data and Discourse) startup, we seek to extend WikiHyperGlossary technologies to other knowledge domains, and integrate them into other knowledge acquisition workflows.

AB  - This article presents a framework and methodology for designing learning goals targeted at what students need to know and be able to do in order to attain high levels of literacy and achievement in three disciplinary areas-literature, science, and history. For each discipline, a team of researchers, teachers, and specialists in that discipline engaged in conceptual meta-analysis of theory and research on the reading, reasoning, and inquiry practices exhibited by disciplinary experts as contrasted with novices. Each team identified discipline-specific clusters of types of knowledge. Across teams, the clusters for each discipline were grouped into 5 higher order categories of core constructs: (a) epistemology; (b) inquiry practices/strategies of reasoning; (c) overarching concepts, themes, and frameworks; (d) forms of information representation/types of texts; and (e) discourse and language structures. The substance of the clusters gave rise to discipline-specific goals and tasks involved in reading across multiple texts, as well as reading, reasoning, and argumentation practices tailored to discipline-specific criteria for evidence-based knowledge claims. The framework of constructs and processes provides a valuable tool for researchers and classroom teachers' (re) conceptualizations of literacy and argumentation learning goals in their specific disciplines.

AB  - Multiple document comprehension (MDC) is defined as the ability to construct an integrated representation based on different sources of information on a particular topic. It is an important competence for both the successful accomplishment of university studies and participation in societal discussions. Yet, there is no established assessment instrument for MDC. Therefore, we developed a test covering four theory-based cognitive requirements of MDC. Based on the data of 310 university students of social sciences and humanities, the MDC test proved to be a unidimensional measure. Furthermore, the test score was related to the final school exam grade, the study level (bachelor/master), and the performance in an essay task. The empirical results suggest that the score of the MDC test can be interpreted as the generic competence of university students to understand multiple documents.

AB  - Information: If you are reading this, you know how important it is and almost certainly look to the biomedical literature for a large part of the information you need. We work hard to find more and more biomedical literature, seeking new content from multiple sources. But, can there be too much of a good thing?
   Most science is reductionist by nature. It is difficult enough finding the relevant nuggets of information from 1,000 documents. It is at least ten times harder to do so from 10,000 documents. And, with 25 million biomedical journal articles and many times that of other textual information sources, we are faced with significant challenges.
   In this introduction, we identify some of those challenges to prepare you for the remaining chapters.

AB  - Surveys of academic staff in six universities in the U.K. provide insights for publishers and universities into scholarly article, book, and other publication reading patterns of academics and differences based on academic discipline of readers. These surveys were part of the 2011 UK Scholarly Reading and the Value of the Library Study funded by JISC Collections and based on Tenopir and King Studies conducted since 1977. Reading patterns of life and environmental scientists differ from other disciplines, in particular social sciences. Scholarly articles, especially those obtained from the library's e-journal collections, are vital to the work of all academic disciplines. Life and environmental scientists come into contact with multiple sources of information every day, including social media, and the biggest limitation scientists describe when it comes to finding and obtaining articles is cost and time. Knowing more about academic reading patterns help publishers and librarians design more effective journal systems and services now and into the future.

AB  - Introduction. The aim of this study was to analyse the role of epistemological beliefs and reading beliefs in the comprehension of multiple texts which presented conflicting positions about a controversial topic (nuclear energy). More specifically, we investigated the influence of the multidimensional configuration of epistemological and reading beliefs on multiple text comprehension.
   Method. The participants were 476 university students from two different Spanish universities, and diverse studies (Humanities, Health Sciences, Architecture and Engineering). In a whole-class session, the Epistemological Beliefs Questionnaire (EQEBI) and the Reader Belief Questionnaire were first administered. In the second part of the session participants completed the prior knowledge questionnaire and performed the multiple text comprehension task.
   Results. Using cluster analysis we identified two distinct beliefs profiles: sophisticated, in which the more sophisticated epistemological beliefs were associated to more transactional and less transmissive reading beliefs; and naive, in which the more naive epistemological beliefs were associated to less transactional and more transmissive reading beliefs. Relationships were found between profiles and gender and domain of knowledge. In addition, after controlling prior knowledge, students with a more sophisticated epistemological and reading beliefs' profile obtained a higher level of multiple text comprehension than those with a more naive profile.
   Conclusion. Consistent with prior research, we may interpret that students who understand knowledge in a more sophisticated way tend to view reading less as a transmissive process and more transforming of knowledge; therefore, they get involved in a deeper comprehension of the different sources and this favours their ability to process information and make inferences - at an intra and inter textual level.

AB  - Lay readers' trust in scientific texts can be shaped by perceived text easiness and scientificness. The two effects seem vital in a time of rapid science information sharing, yet have so far only been examined separately. A preregistered online study was conducted to assess them jointly, to probe for author and text trustworthiness overlap, and to investigate interindividual influences on the effects. N = 1467 lay readers read four short research summaries, with easiness and scientificness (high vs low) being experimentally varied. A more scientific writing style led to higher perceived author and text trustworthiness. Higher personal justification belief, lower justification by multiple-sources belief, and lower need for cognitive closure attenuated the influence of scientificness on trustworthiness. However, text easiness showed no influence on trustworthiness and no interaction with text scientificness. Implications for future studies and suggestions for enhancing the perceived trustworthiness of research summaries are discussed.

AB  - Novel externalities are social activities for which the emerging cost (or benefit) of the spillover is unknown and must be discovered. Negative novel externalities have regained international salience following the COVID-19 pandemic. Such cases frequently are invoked as evidence of the limits of liberal political economy for dealing with public emergencies. Through a re-reading of classical political economy with the modern state's confrontation with infectious disease in mind, we defend the comparative efficacy of liberal democracy against authoritarian alternatives for coping with these social problems. Effective responses to novel externalities require producing and updating trustworthy public information and an independent scientific community to validate and interpret it. Those epistemic capacities are prevalent in liberal democratic regimes with multiple sources of political power, an independent civil society, and practices of academic freedom. Our analysis highlights the theoretical value of polycentrism and self-governance beyond their more familiar role, of increasing accountability and competition in the provision of local public goods, towards facilitating effective national policy.

AB  - Students read six documents that varied in terms of their perspectives on a scientific issue and the trustworthiness of the source features. After reading, students wrote essays, rank-ordered the documents according to perceived trustworthiness, and provided reasons for their rank-order decisions. Students put the most trust in a textbook and a public information text, primarily giving content reasons for their trustworthiness judgments. The kind of source characteristics that students drew upon when deciding what to trust and what not to trust varied across documents.

AB  - We are surrounded by data, a vast amount of data that has brought about an increasing need for combining and analyzing it in order to extract information and generate knowledge. A need not exclusive of big software companies with expert programmers; from scientists to bloggers, many end-user programmers currently demand data management tools to generate information according to their discretion. However, data is usually distributed among multiple sources, hence, it requires to be integrated, and unfortunately, this process is still available just for professional developers. In this paper we propose DataSheets, a novel approach to make the data-flow specification accessible and its representation comprehensible to end-user programmers. This approach consists of a spreadsheet-based data-flow language that has been tested and evaluated in a service-centric composition framework.

AB  - Today, we stand on the threshold of the new medical revolution, and learning to read the code of life, and this revolution offers big hope to people suffering from all kinds of diseases. The complexity and variability in disease classification is a great challenge to overcome. Disease classification is routinely composed of healthcare units streaming data from multiple sources simultaneously e.g., pathology, genomics, imaging, and electrophysiology etc. To efficiently fathom the wealth of healthcare, there is a crucial need to generate appropriate disease-treatment annotation repositories accessed through modern technologies. One platform that has proven to be an efficient tool in several areas including healthcare, is the multi-purpose mobile computing devices e.g., smart phone and tablet computer. Our focus here was to develop a mobile application with a comprehensive database for efficient management and access to International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and National Drug Code (NDC) for epidemiology, health management, clinical support, and scientific research. Innovative and smart systems are necessary to improve the quality and transition of healthcare by understanding heterogeneous healthcare and related data. In this manuscript, we present PAS-Code, an iOS app developed with Swift and PHP scripting that uses a MySQL server database, which includes over 80,000 ICDs maintained by the World Health Organization and over 123,000 NDCs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. It enables users worldwide to install the application on Apple mobile devices and search for medical classified codes, disease, drugs, and related information such as, signs and symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances, and external causes of injury. PAS-Code is an exclusively academic application founded on the clinical, scientific, and modern technology premise to support healthcare and enable scientific data retrieval using efficient mobile-based tools. It has the potential to assist clinical researchers by providing enhanced exposure to ICD and NDC with greater visibility and easy browsing. These set of codes are highly significant at every level of healthcare.

AB  - Pretrained language models (PLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on many natural language process-ing (NLP) tasks. Despite their great success, these PLMs are typically pretrained only on unstructured free texts without leveraging existing structured knowledge bases that are readily available for many domains, especially scientific domains. As a result, these PLMs may not achieve satisfactory performance on knowledge-intensive tasks such as biomedical NLP. Comprehending a complex biomedical document without domain-specific knowledge is challenging, even for humans. Inspired by this observation, we propose a general framework for incorporating various types of domain knowledge from multiple sources into biomedical PLMs. We encode domain knowledge using lightweight adapter modules, bottleneck feed-forward networks that are inserted into different locations of a backbone PLM. For each knowledge source of interest, we pretrain an adapter module to capture the knowledge in a self-supervised way. We design a wide range of self-supervised objectives to accommodate diverse types of knowledge, ranging from entity relations to description sentences. Once a set of pretrained adapters is available, we employ fusion layers to combine the knowledge encoded within these adapters for downstream tasks. Each fusion layer is a parameterized mixer of the available trained adapters that can identify and activate the most useful adapters for a given input. Our method diverges from prior work by including a knowledge consolidation phase, during which we teach the fusion layers to effectively combine knowledge from both the original PLM and newly-acquired external knowledge using a large collection of unannotated texts. After the consolidation phase, the complete knowledge-enhanced model can be fine-tuned for any downstream task of interest to achieve optimal performance. Extensive experiments on many biomedical NLP datasets show that our proposed framework consistently improves the performance of the underlying PLMs on various downstream tasks such as natural language inference, question answering, and entity linking. These results demonstrate the benefits of using multiple sources of external knowledge to enhance PLMs and the effectiveness of the framework for incorporating knowledge into PLMs. While primarily focused on the biomedical domain in this work, our framework is highly adaptable and can be easily applied to other domains, such as the bioenergy sector.

AB  - Multiple document comprehension (MDC) refers to the ability to integrate information from multiple sources into a coherent representation, which requires specific cognitive processes. Assuming that epistemic beliefs are domain-related, this study investigates exploratively how epistemic beliefs in the domains of science and history affect the mastery of cognitive requirements in domain-general MDC (e.g. the comparison of source information). 156 university students reported their epistemic beliefs in physics or history and completed a computer-based test measuring their MDC. The results showed that MDC was significantly predicted by the epistemic beliefs dimension of personal justification in physics. A conservative approach revealed no interaction effects between epistemic beliefs and the mastery of specific cognitive requirements but results of a liberal approach hinted at associations with epistemic beliefs in physics rather than history. The results are discussed with respect to the nature of epistemic beliefs and theoretical assumptions regarding their relations to MDC requirements.

AB  - This study presents a descriptive analysis of 71 videotaped lessons taught by 34 highly regarded secondary English language arts, history, and science teachers, collected to inform an intervention focused on evidence-based argumentation from multiple text sources. Studying the practices of highly regarded teachers is valuable for identifying promising practices and stubborn obstacles to reform. We found that although these highly regarded teachers allocated 3 times more class time to working with text than to teacher lecture and explanation, opportunities to engage in text-based argumentation with multiple sources were rare. Furthermore, less than a 3rd of the time allocated to working with text engaged students in actively making meaning from text. When literacy tasks did occur, they were associated with a disciplinary knowledge focus, challenging the notion that literacy activity occurs at the expense of content instruction. Close reading and cross-textual analysis frequently co-occurred with each other and with argumentation, which suggests that intervention designs should foreground these building blocks of argumentation. Disciplinary differences in opportunity to learn indicate that norms of instruction may carry greater weight than disciplinary norms of reasoning and discourse, which suggests that a particular focus on transforming literacy instruction in science may be warranted.

AB  - This study used think-aloud methodology to investigate 51 Norwegian undergraduates' topic-specific epistemic cognition while working with six documents presenting conflicting views on the issue of cell phones and potential health risks. Results showed that students' epistemic cognition was represented by one dimension concerning the certainty and simplicity of knowledge and three dimensions concerning the justification for knowing by different sources. Moreover, components of a mechanism of change, in particular epistemic doubt and resolution strategies, were identified in the think-aloud protocols. Finally, these mechanism of change components seemed to operate within distinct dimensions of epistemic cognition. Three case studies were used to elaborate on and illustrate how epistemic cognition may be differently involved in the reading of multiple conflicting documents over the course of reading.

AB  - Background: Developmental disabilities have been largely studied in the past years. Their etiological mechanisms have been underpinned to the interactions between genetic and environmental factors. These factors show variability across the world. Thus, it is important to understand where the set of knowledge obtained on developmental disabilities originates from and whether it is generalizable to low-and middle-income countries. Aims: This study aims to understand the origins of the available literature on developmental disabilities, keeping a focus on parenting, and identify the main trend of research. Methods and Procedure: A sample of 11,315 publications from 1936 to 2020 were collected from Scopus and a graphical country analysis was conducted. Furthermore, a qualitative approach enabled the clustering of references by keywords into four main areas: "Expression of the disorder", "Physiological Factors", "How it is studied" and "Environmental factors". For each area, a document co-citation analysis (DCA) on CiteSpace software was performed. Outcomes and Results: Results highlight the leading role of North America in the study of developmental disabilities. Trends in the literature and the documents' scientific relevance are discussed in details. Conclusions and Implications: Results demand for investigation in different socio-economical settings to generalize our knowledge. What this paper adds? The current paper tries to provide insight into the origins of the literature on developmental disabilities with a focus on parenting, together with an analysis of the trends of research in the field. The paper consisted of a multi-disciplinary and multi-method review. In fact, the review tried to integrate the analysis of the relation between developmental disabilities with a closer look at the scientific contributions to the field across the world. Specifically, the paper integrates a total of 11,315 papers published on almost a century of research (from 1936 to 2020). An initial qualitative analysis on keywords was combined to a subsequent quantitative approach in order to maximize the comprehension of the impact of almost a century of scientific contributions. Specifically, documents were studied with temporal and structural metrics on a scientometric approach. This allowed the exploration of patterns within the literature available on Scopus in a quantitative way. This method not only assessed the importance of single documents within the network. As a matter of fact, the document co-citation analysis used on CiteSpace software provided insight into the relations existing between multiple documents in the field of research. As a result, the leading role of North America in the literature of developmental disabilities and parenting emerged. This was accompanied by the review of the main trends of research within the existing literature.

AB  - Background: Obtaining informed consent is a cornerstone of biomedical research, yet participants comprehension of presented information is often low. The most effective interventions to improve understanding rates have not been identified.
   Purpose: To systematically analyze the random controlled trials testing interventions to research informed consent process. The primary outcome of interest was quantitative rates of participant understanding; secondary outcomes were rates of information retention, satisfaction, and accrual. Interventional categories included multimedia, enhanced consent documents, extended discussions, test/feedback quizzes, and miscellaneous methods.
   Methods: The search spanned from database inception through September 2010. It was run on Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid CINAHL, Ovid PsycInfo and Cochrane CENTRAL, ISI Web of Science and Scopus. Five reviewers working independently and in duplicate screened full abstract text to determine eligibility. We included only RCTs. 39 out of 1523 articles fulfilled review criteria (2.6%), with a total of 54 interventions. A data extraction form was created in Distiller, an online reference management system, through an iterative process. One author collected data on study design, population, demographics, intervention, and analytical technique.
   Results: Meta-analysis was possible on 22 interventions: multimedia, enhanced form, and extended discussion categories; all 54 interventions were assessed by review. Meta-analysis of multimedia approaches was associated with a non-significant increase in understanding scores (SMD 0.30, 95% CI, -0.23 to 0.84); enhanced consent form, with significant increase (SMD 1.73, 95% CI, 0.99 to 2.47); and extended discussion, with significant increase (SMD 0.53, 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.84). By review, 31% of multimedia interventions showed significant improvement in understanding; 41% for enhanced consent form; 50% for extended discussion; 33% for test/feedback; and 29% for miscellaneous. Multiple sources of variation existed between included studies: control processes, the presence of a human proctor, real vs. simulated protocol, and assessment formats.
   Conclusions: Enhanced consent forms and extended discussions were most effective in improving participant understanding. Interventions of all categories had no negative impact on participant satisfaction or study accrual.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to reveal the knowledge evolution process, research hotspots and future trends in the accessible tourism research literature from 2008 to 2020. Design/methodology/approach A total of 213 articles on accessible tourism were selected from the core collection database of Web of Science (WoS) and analyzed using CiteSpace. Findings Over the 13-year period between 2008 and 2020, an increasing number of studies have been published concerning accessible tourism, but the overall base is still small. The research content mainly includes six modules. Among institutions, the University of Technology Sydney has published the largest number of papers. Cooperation among countries involves the USA, the United Kingdom, Australia, Portugal and China. Tourism Management is the leading journal for disseminating research on accessible tourism. Definition of "Accessible tourism" and the different scope of this phenomenon are re-discussed. In recent years, "experience" and "participation" have become the "new favorites" in accessible tourism research, which could reveal insights into future research directions. Research limitations/implications The sampling frame was defined in terms of the WoS database and even though this is an important database for global academic information, in the big data era, the authors may have to integrate information from multiple sources to comprehensively reveal and understand knowledge maps. Second, because of the operational constraints of the CiteSpace software, the authors only selected outputs published in peer-reviewed journals, excluding other published works, such as books and conference papers. Finally, because of the language restrictions of the authors, this research is limited to journals published in the English language. Practical implications Practically, the results of this study made a conclusion of accessible tourism research so that the researchers can easily know what has currently been done and what future research can do. Tourism managers can also understand the demands and the constraints of tourism for the people who have barriers to travel. They can supply more specific products for the accessible tourism and further promote the construction of barrier-free travel environments. Originality/value This paper unifies the literature on senior tourism and people with disabilities tourism, and uses CiteSpace to construct data and network visualizations, including a burst and dynamic analysis for the period covered by the sample. Furthermore, this paper proposed a more diversified accessible tourism.

AB  - Building a robust Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system and improving recognition accuracy in adverse conditions is stilla challenging task. One way to improve the robustness of an ASR system is combining information from multiple sources (streams). A multi-stream approach which handles the multiple inputs at the model level is the key contribution of our work. Standard mic (Sm), Throat mic (T-m), and Lip reading (L-r) are the various source streams that have been used. This work explores a static weighted two stream HMM (TSH) and multi-stream HMM (MSH) model for the bimodal and multimodal systems. A syllabic units of the Hindi language database categorized into three categories - Vowel, Place of Articulation (POA), and Manner of Articulation (MOA) are used for training and testing. In this study, four types of TSH are proposed for the combination of bimodal ((S-m + T-m), (T-m + L-r), (S-m + L-r), (L-m + L-m)) systems and one type MSH is proposed for multimodal (S-m + T-m+L-r) system in a synchronous and asynchronous manner. Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) features are used for S-m and T-m signals. Combined pixel-motion based features (DCT/DWT-MHI) are used for L-r signals. Among these two features, DWT outperforms than DCT and used as a feature for visual speech. Experiments were conducted for bimodal and multimodal system. The proposed MSH approach shows improvements of 1.36%, 6.21%, and 5.8% in recognition accuracy for Vowel, POA and MOA category respectively, as compared to bimodal systems.

AB  - Javier Fernandez Sebastian's edited collections of essays, Political Concepts and Time, is both a critical homage to the monumental work of Reinhart Koselleck (19232006) and an important contribution to the methodology of history-writing. Centered on the polysemic nature of concepts, which are read as vehicles for thought studied in their pragmatic and communicative applications in society, Political Concepts and Time provides a stimulating analysis of the role, weight, and future of conceptual history. Its thirteen essays offer an account of problems, questions, and debates on the interplay of words and concepts, meaning and historical change, context and discourse. They endeavor to clarify the complicated and perennially unresolved relationship between theory and practice. In order to do so, Fernandez Sebastian has assembled a scholarly composite and broadly international group of specialists from a variety of disciplines and research fields. With the intellectual legacy of Koselleck's Begriffsgeschichte looming large, this book rethinks the ways in which not just historians but also social scientists and philosophers study the past as the expression of contingent, ever-changing, and revocable semantic units shaping the culturally plural worlds we inhabit. Informed by the idea that history is porous, Political Concepts and Time also deals with the perhaps obvious but no less challenging issue of our approach to time as everyday experience and through its representation(s). Together with exploring the volume's specific historical topics, this essay will highlight some of its limitations and, above all, will respond to its criticism of intellectual history. The following pages will thus argue the case for the latter methodological perspective by reflecting on the type of historian it delineates. Claiming that in their investigation of past meanings intellectual historians make use of creative imagination, the essay will suggest that this model of history-writing leads to a better understanding of multiple sources and that it might ultimately help overcome some of the inconsistencies and often simplistic divisions between various branches of the historiographical tree. In particular, a small proposal to reconcile conceptual and intellectual history will be advanced.

AB  - The analysis of the consumers shopping online play a substantial role in forming the intentions of purchasing others. The digital platforms are progressing day in, and day out, providing the chance to the customers to share and state their opinions, views, and opinions. Simultaneously, it is developing a strong means of marketing recognized as electronic word of mouth (e-WOM) which has gotten an essential source to gather the details concerning products for the consumers. Review consensus provides comprehensiveness to e-WOM Single or limited reviews fail to give a complete picture to the eWOM, thus, to permit customers to make a proper decision, multiple studies with similarities amongst them are needed In the current survey, 328 online customers have been chosen by a standard questionnaire designated on a five-step interval scale. Multiple regression and Mean score have been employed to analyze the data. The data analysis was performed utilizing SPSS 20.0 (Statistical Package for Social Sciences). Based on the results acquired, it was discovered that the majority of the review consensus aspects' own a favorable effect on e-WOM and E-Purchase Satisfaction for consumer goods. It was found from the study that the variables such as extended reviews are always better for review consensus if it is found positive reviews, even if there is a consensus, they can be considered to be biased, and Higher review consensus can only be achieved when we explore multiple sources of reviews are the most significant concerning the buyer's interaction towards reviews. However, at the same time, the purchase is influenced by E-WOM; review consensus depends upon the purpose of purchasing the product.

AB  - The present paper puts forward some of the processes and results of a research project aimed at studying and analysing pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) (Shulman, 2005; Bolivar, 2005; Grossman, 2005; Marcelo, 2009) in university teaching staff.
   This study is framed within a coordinated project, financed by the Ministry of Science and Innovation from the government of Spain, and where three Spanish universities participate: University of Barcelona, University of Santiago de Compostela and University of Sevilla.
   Each of the three universities profound PCK's analysis on one of university teachers' development stage: novel (U. of Sevilla), intermediate (U. of Santiago de Compostela), and expert (University of Barcelona).
   This paper is focused on the case of the University of Barcelona. Precisely, and within this case, it shows how highly-competent teaching professionals transform their disciplinary knowledge into accessible and comprehensible forms and structures for their students, and that this process is based on a kind of pedagogical reasoning -sometimes of intuitive nature -which allows them reorganizing and transforming their professional knowledge for teaching a particular subject, issue or topic. Research comprises two stages: 1) sample identification and selection: multiple sources and instruments were used for information collection with the aim of identifying a sample of teaching professionals at the University of Barcelona (UB) acknowledged for their high content preparation and command, as well as for their relevant capacity to encourage their students to learn; and 2) this second stage, posed as a multiple case study (Stake, 1998), focuses on analysing PCK signs in the teaching interactive stage (Jackson, 2000) of 3 widely-acknowledged UB teaching professionals. Taking classroom observation as the main data-collection strategy -yet considering the contributions of other instruments such as in-depth and group interviews -research provides relevant information about certain PCK signs in university teaching and the practical reasoning and theoretical fundamentals behind the teaching practice of the professionals who took part in the present study.

AB  - Purpose The Covid-19 pandemic has profoundly affected urban communities, generating the need for an immediate response from local governance. The availability of urban data platforms in some smart cities helped the relevant actors to develop various solutions in an innovative and highly contextual way. The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of data platforms in smart cities in the context of the Covid-19 crisis. Design/methodology/approach A total of 85 studies were identified using the Clarivate Analytics Web of Science electronic library. After applying exclusion and inclusion criteria, 61 publications were considered appropriate and reasonable for the research, being read in-depth. Finally, only 52 studies presented relevant information for the topic and were synthesized following the defined research questions. During the research, the authors included in the paper other interesting references found in selected articles and important information regarding the role of data in the fight against Covid-19 in smart cities available on the Internet and social media, with the intention to capture both academic and practical perspectives. Findings The authors' main conclusion suggests that based on their previous expertise in collecting, processing and analyzing data from multiple sources, some smart cities quickly adapted their data platforms for an efficient response against Covid-19. The results highlight the importance of open data, data sharing, innovative thinking, the collaboration between public and private stakeholders, and the participation of citizens, especially in these difficult times. Practical implications The city managers and data operators can use the presented case studies and findings to identify relevant data-driven smart solutions in the fight against Covid-19 or another crisis. Social implications The performance of smart cities is a social concern since the population of urban communities is continuously growing. By reviewing the adoption of information technologies-based solutions to improve the quality of citizens' life, the paper emphasizes their potential in societies in which information technology is embedded, especially during a major crisis. Originality/value This research re-emphasizes the importance of collecting data in smart cities, the role of the diversity of their sources and the necessity of citizens, companies and government synergetic involvement, especially in a pandemic context. The existence of smart solutions to process and extract information and knowledge from large data sets was essential for many actors involved in smart cities, helping them in the decision-making process. Based on previous expertise, some smart cities quickly adapted their data platforms for an efficient response against Covid-19. The paper analyzes also these success cases that can be considered models to be adopted by other municipalities in similar circumstances.

AB  - Background Motor learning (ML) science is foundational for physical therapy. However, multiple sources of evidence have indicated a science-practice gap. Clinicians report low self-efficacy with ML concepts and indicate that the lack of access to systematic training is a barrier for practical implementation. The general goal of this preliminary study was to describe the effects of a new educational intervention on physical therapy student's ML self-efficacy and knowledge. Methods Self-efficacy was assessed with the Physical Therapists' Perceptions of Motor Learning questionnaire. Data was acquired from third-semester students before their participation in the ML educational intervention. Reference self-efficacy data was also acquired from physical therapy professionals and first and last-semester students. The educational intervention for third-semester students was designed around an established framework to apply ML principles to rehabilitation. A direct experience, the "Learning by Doing" approach, in which students had to choose a motor skill to acquire over 10 weeks, provided the opportunity to apply ML theory to practice in a personally meaningful way. After the intervention self-efficacy was re-tested. ML knowledge was tested with an objective final exam. Content analysis of coursework material was used to determine how students comprehended ML theory and related it to their practical experience. The Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare self-efficacy scores between the four groups. Changes in self-efficacy after the educational intervention were analyzed with the Wilcoxon test. Spearman rank correlation analysis was used to test the association between self-efficacy and final exam grades. Results By the end of the intervention, students' self-efficacy had significantly increased (p < 0.03), was higher than that of senior students (p < 0.00) and experienced professionals (p < 0.00) and correlated with performance on an objective knowledge test (p < 0.03). Content analysis revealed that students learned to apply the elements of ML-based interventions present in the scientific literature to a real-life, structured ML program tailored to personal objectives. Conclusions Positive improvements were observed after the intervention. These results need confirmation with a controlled study. Because self-efficacy mediates the clinical application of knowledge and skills, systematic, active training in ML may help reduce the science-practice gap.

AB  - Big data has, as of late been perceived as one of the most significant domains of upcoming innovation. It has been fascinated numerous enterprises, since it can possibly explore organizations with high market worth. The paper investigates the types of market worth that organizations can make from big data analytics (BDA), the immediate effects it has on the economical performance of an industry, and the impacts of retail performance and consumer loyalty. According to the hypothesis upon resource-based view, investigation exhibits that the market value accomplished from interests in BDA prompts the interest as far as the economical performance (EP) of an industry. The survey is composed of two segments. The first segment, which was replied by all the industries, estimated the nearness or absence of BDA arrangements. We segregated the replies to this segment, and if the responders acknowledged certifiably, they were then approached to involve in the next segment of the poll. Out of the 300 finished questionnaires, 146 of the surveys were discovered appropriate to analyze our model, when our segregating questions in the first segment of the survey had been executed. The outcomes offer proof of the presence of a consumer loyalty (CL) intervention impact and of the absence of a retail performance (RP) impact. Hypothetical and pragmatic ramifications are conferred towards the last part of paper. BDA arrangements should be designed comprehensively to produce operational, organizational, structural and informational value. The outcomes of this research will assist in improving logical information at the junction of innovation and the board sciences. This study has some limitations that open up interesting opportunities for future research. First, this study has had a cross-sectional research design, in which all the measurement items were collected at the same point of time. A longitudinal study could extend this research by capturing the dynamics of the business value of big data analytics arrangements on different industry performances. Second, this research has employed one data collection method. Objective data from multiple sources could be used to further verify the proposed research model. This study has extended relevant theories in big data analytics arrangements by framing, in an original combination, four dimensions of the market worth of big data analytics arrangements on one outcome construct, that is, economical performance and the mediation variable of consumer loyalty.

AB  - Ecological signs of Earth's biosphere forewarn an alarming trajectory towards a global mass-extinction. Assessing species performance and susceptibilities to decline is essential to comprehend and reverse this trend. Yet it is challenging, given difficulties associated with quantifying individual and population processes that are variable across time, space, and life-stages. We describe anew approach to estimating and comparing species performances that combines empirical data, a novel theoretical consideration of population dynamics, and modern statistics. Our approach allows for a more realistic continuous representation of individual performances along development stages while taking into account non-linearity, and natural variability as captured by spatio-temporally replicated observations. We illustrate its application in a coral meta-assemblage composed of populations of the three major reef-building taxa Acropora, Pocillopora, Porites. Using a unique set of highly replicated observations of individual coral dynamics under various environmental conditions, we show how taxa differ in their investment in recruitment and size-specific aptitude for growth and survival, notably through different use of clonal shrinkage, fragmentation, fission, and fusion processes. Our results reveal contrasting life-history trade-offs among taxa which, along with differing patterns of density-dependent recruitment, modulate species responses to decline. These differences in coral life history traits reflect opposing life-strategies, imply regulation at differing life-stages, and explain divergence in species trajectories. Our findings indicate a high potential for resilience in Pocillopora and Porites populations, thanks respectively to a sustained recruitment that promotes demographic elasticity through replacement of individuals, and a steady resistance to mortality which confers persistence through lingering of individuals. Resilience in Acropora appears more arbitrary, given high susceptibility to perturbations and dependency of recruitment on presence of established local populations. We identify management actions that can complement Acropora's life history and benefit recovery of its populations following mortality events. Our regression-modelling approach to quantifying and comparing species performances in different population processes is applicable to all taxa, as illustrated even those with complex clonal life histories, and can be implemented at wide spatio-temporal and taxonomic coverage. It can promote more accurate representation of species dynamics in both descriptive and predictive modelling approaches. The semi-parametric contrast curve method we develop facilitates comparing response variables along continuous explicative metrics while accounting for multiple sources of complexity in empirical data. It should widely benefit investigations in ecology and quantitative science. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The growing concept of Industry 5.0 (IR 5.0) has enhanced the study horizon of the technology-centered Industry 4.0 (IR 4.0) to an intelligent and balanced socioeconomic change powered mutually by people and technologies. The role of humans in the technological revolution is largely focused on IR 5.0, which is already a future trend. IR 4.0's cyber-physical systems revolution has evolved into IR 5.0, or in other words, from machine-to-machine integration to human-to-machine integration, which is radically altering how people live, work, and interact with one another. Therefore, the current study aims to comprehensively review transformation through industrial revolutions and provide a way forward in the construction industry with the incorporation of IR 5.0. This study has used a narrative-based research methodology in which multiple databases such as Scopus, Web of Sciences, Google Scholar, and Science Direct have been utilized for extracting articles related to the subject area of the current study. Moreover, through narrative-based methodology, which is a generic-based review technique, the information gathered from multiple sources has been summarized and synthesized. The findings of the review indicate that resilience, human-centricity, economic efficiency, and sustainable development are the key characteristics of IR 5.0. Moreover, the adoption of IR 5.0 in the construction industry also faces some major challenges such as a shortage of IR 5.0-related technical skills, investment-hesitancy among investors, security, and cultural concerns for human-to-machine integration, and an unavailability of data for effective decision-making for governments and stakeholders. The study results also highlight that with selective technology adoption, project teams embracing IR 5.0 for improved collaboration and coordination, more environmentally friendly technology adoption through human-to-machine collaboration, and stakeholders leveraging the power of human knowledge and innovative proficiency through machines, reforms can be brought into the construction industry through the incorporation of IR 5.0. It is also important to keep in mind that adopting IR 4.0 is still difficult in some areas and it may seem like achieving IR 5.0 will require years of effort and significant cultural change; however, it needs to be considered right away. The effects of disruptive technologies on Industry 4.0 are covered in several studies; however, IR 5.0 is a novel idea that is still in its early stages, thus its consequences have not been well examined in the construction industry. Therefore, the current study has expanded the body of knowledge on this important subject in detail and has comprehensively explained the transformation by providing a way forward for the adoption of IR 5.0 in the construction industry.
